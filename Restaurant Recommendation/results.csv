well let us cut this review short over all it is acceptable yet is not as expected near to most of the main hotels there affordable npr and within average ordered dhal thali two mo mo s one pumpkin soup dhal with roti humble host and kind you can ask for his help preparation of food will take more than expected for a fast food the restaurant is located on a very noisy road non stop honking and cars passing by food taste was not as expected service could be in the slack side when it is needed at times overall it will get three starts rating just be mindful when reading reviews around the country it could be misleading sometimes,Positive

almost most of the items in their menu are awesome and doner kebab is the best one one must try,Positive
at first i thought the place had only one table by the side of the road but they have a sitting area inside the building the taste was refreshing as it had tons of vegetables and vinegar soaked carrots and beetroot and hot sauce on the side i found the french fries a little too much in the filling but few and small chicken pieces,Negative
the shwarma was just ok lacked the authentic taste,Negative
unfortunately i already had the best falafel wrap in pokhara so i couldnt help but compare this one was of its size and didnt have much fresh veggies which i think a good falafel wrap has still the taste was good just not what i expected,Positive

holy moly that was as good as the reviews suggested,Positive
fulfilling and worth the prize the pickled vegetables jalepenos and bullet chillis was something you wouldnt easily get at other falafel place and its makes the falafel so much better also it gives city vibes when you eat at the small spot just adjacent to the entrance,Positive

not like real pizza but fun atmosphere and great staff,Positive
thankyou for your response i am not denying what happened but their tone and the way they spoke was what made us upset we understand the difference between being nice and rude if it was just me i would have not said anything but everyone felt the same we were not aware about the rules had this been said politely we wouldnt have any issue we wouldve gladly accepted were at fault,Negative
the pizza here has become bland and tasteless there are lots of new pizza place like sicily roadhouse cafe pizza hut that provide much better quality pizza in my opinion,Negative
nice place to go after trekking for some good pizza service is a little slow and inattentive but still good,Positive
excellent place for pizza lovers and cocktails in kathmandu must recommended,Positive
hadnt been here in years bright and clean ambience a sense of happiness in the air very attentive polite and helpful staff the pizza menu was diverse and the outcome was tasty the pizza was wetter than ideal for my taste and issue i have experienced with road house as well nepal really needs to add ginger beer not just ginger ale to the menu this would be a game changer to any pizza joint and restaurant the italian salad was very fresh and tasty the potato chips were soso,Positive
we came from india not expected this kind of rude behavior,Positive
the pizza was delicious no doubt about that however the staff was very rude and lacked basic etiquette i went there with my friends from india and all of us were quite disappointed with how we were treated the staff spoke impolitely and the overall atmosphere was unwelcoming its unfortunate because the food was great but i wouldnt visit again due to the poor customer service a good experience is about more than just the food,Negative
food is nice but the staffs are very very rude they do not have manners and the way they talk is not nicee i would not like to visit such places i would rather prefer going on the place which has decent taste but where staffs are polite,Negative
the ambience of fire and ice is classic its one of a kind in nepal now lets talk about the food i was utterly disappointed by the level of food that was served the whole purpose of my visit as a vegetarian critique to this place was the taste the elegance of pizza that nepal has to offer but no my expectations was shattered by how plain the food was pizza the crust was fine but it seemed as though the crust was just an elevated version of roti a classic nepali staple no it doesnt go with the taste of pizza second it was very bland where is the pizza sauce blended tomato is not pizza sauce it was almost nonexistent now i ordered the classic fire and ice pizza and what did i get an elevated version of roti with tomato sauce topped with cheese and potato and two drops of pesto potato seriously in a pizza as a staple no i have had fire and ice before it was sublime i still remember the incredible taste they had to offer a decade ago and now to think that the quality has degraded as such its a shame chips what i have never tasted anything so bland i couldnt even finish it and the sauce it came with abysmal you got to realize that you cant simply pair two things and call it a dish cost is reasonable as international standard kitchen paying for a full portion of chips is entirely reasonable but come on at least make a little effort in making the dish a little better i would never recommend the fancy french name hidden bland potato chips to anyone overall the ambience of the place and server is good but im sorry going here for food especially in todays standard is not worth it at all in one word disappointed,Negative
had the imported ham mushroom added some garlic was actually very good going to try the calzone today you will not be disappointed,Positive
i visited this place with a friend who introduced me to her new yoga group there were seven of us and the restaurant was perfect for a larger gathering to be honest i didnt expect to find such authentic italian pizza in this area but i did i truly enjoyed my margherita sipping on an aperol spritz and sharing stories about life and travel with people i had just met the staff were incredibly friendly helpful and attentive the warm inviting atmosphere makes it easy to relax connect and enjoy great italian food its also easy to find just turn off the main street and look for the sign check the photo i added for reference highly recommended,Positive
some of the best pizza you will find in nepal probably the best pizza you will find km from kathmandu great atmosphere amazing toppings and the crust is thin firm and droopy when it needs to be it is almost like annapurna herself has blessed this pizzaria this is the spot i go to after a long weeks work in the himalayas because it feels like home,Positive
one of the best italian restaurants in nepal i was pleasantly surprised by the crust and dough of the pizza authentic and light the pizzas were excellent while the vegetarian lasagna was just okay the atmosphere doesnt feel like you are in nepal although it was a bit noisy for my taste prices are a little high by nepal standards but the quality makes it worth it a great spot for italian food in kathmandu,Positive
para as referencias locais a pizza e bem boa talvez a melhor da cidade mas e cara para os padroes locais,Positive
ive visited this restaurant multiple times as a casual customer but today in a moment of real urgency i was rudely denied access to the restroom it wasnt just disappointingit was inhumane basic decency and compassion were completely missing i hope the management reflects on what hospitality truly means,Positive

loved the pizza unlike other authentic italian pizza joints their crust was the perfect balance of not being so thick doughy but being dense enough to carry the toppings plus the crust alone is quite flavorful crispy the soft topped center the robust crust balances perfectly,Positive

this is quite a popular italian restaurant and comes highly recommended the staff are helpful and on top of their game the antipasti is amazing as was the potato chips we had a ricotta pizza as well as the tuna pizza which were both great lively place with great vibes,Positive
the only problem i had was i couldnt find french fries on the menu other than that it was perfect kudos to the boy who recommended barahsinghe when we asked for his favourite beer its our favourite as well now,Positive
wonderful gluten free pizza place we had brilliant interactions on both occasions with staff and trying to speak the nepali language please be respectful as always in nepal and dont be rude and rowdy with outwards behaviours enjoy the food enjoy the experiences and make sure to generously tip in cash as the staff make every effort to deliver dont be a scrooge in fact anywhere in nepal,Positive
i decided to visit once more for one last chance the result was burnt pizza worse every time expensive prices from italy,Positive
schade das der service nicht zum ambiente und leckerem essen passt leider ist man trotz das es eins der gehobeneren restaurants in kathmandu ist sehr unflexibel pizza belege konnen nicht gewechselt werden beim kids menu gibt es nur eine sorte an pizza es kann kein anderer belag genommen werden das ganze wird ziemlich desinteressiert heruber gebracht die pizzen und salat allerdings muss man eingestehen sind richtig gut,Positive

best pizza in kathmandu,Positive
pizza is the best here and i usually go for half and half option picture below is half pepperoni and half ettore basically minced chicken with sundried tomatoes for vegetarian mates paesana is super yummy that comes with zucchini spinach and mozzarella seating is completely indoors with some seats next to windows overlooking temples nearby paid parking also available,Positive
pizza were great and good service,Positive
oh this has to be one of those overrated food joints made popular by the tourists for some reason the food was average the pizza tasted weird something wrong with the dough even though they claim its freshly made their speciality of fried chips is so bland youd need a tub of salt just so its palatable the salsa that comes along with it is more like a green store bought paste not at all fresh or tasty there are much better authentic italian food joints in the surrounding area a place called vera pizza for eg was amazing,Positive
as a foreigner in this country with a pizza pampered palate i would say this is the best pizza in ktm,Positive
typical thin crust but i love the pizzas more at the ktm outlet,Positive
been here days in a row its very good,Positive

worst pizza i have ever had toppings were bare minimum and onion lekhera boiled potato halera deko thiyo,Negative
pollo pizza was one of the worst pizzas i have ever had says fresh onion but u put boiled potatoes very bad experience,Negative
my daughters and i visited this place on our first night in kathmandu based on fairly good reviews in google map and also since it is very close to the hotel we are staying at oasis kathmandu hotel we ordered salad potatoes margherita pizza and alio olio pasta all was good except the pasta was a bit bland the service was excellent and the atmosphere was good the only thing is that the price is a bit on the expensive side nevertheless it was a good meal,Positive
cozy setting paired with its excellent service creates a pleasant dining experience its a mustvisit for anyone craving italian cuisine in kathmandu,Positive
an oftenvisited italian restaurant with consistent food for the most part except for the softy icecream which lately does not have the same quality less vanilla flavor service is fast without compromising on the taste nice ambience favorites include rompipalle pizza potato chips made inhouse and nutella crepes,Positive
very nice place plenty of traditional pizzeria options,Positive
pizza meno buona del previsto buoni ingredienti ma pasta e lievitazione non eccezionali sapore poco deciso cornicione non bombato una pizza liscia meglio di altre ma un po delusi,Negative
staff was friendly food was authentic especially the pizza and tiramisu soft serve ice cream was not bad but the cone leaked alot,Positive
tried fire and ice during our nepal visit one of the best place to have pizza,Positive
we were really craving italian food after spending a few weeks in asia and this place did not disappoint we went a few times and tried different pasta and pizza dishes everything was very nicely made and tasty but i would especially recommend the pizzas the place is constantly busy and often has a queue to enter it seems to be a place with lots of international customers the service is extremely good efficient and quick,Positive
amazing pizza with perfect crust,Positive
i recently dined at fire and ice pizzeria upon arrivai i was greeted by a staff member asked for table occupancy and escorted to a table professional the welcoming cozy ambiance with all of the hallmark achievements of the place as well as rules for the customers surely set the perfect tone for a meal one of the highlights was the menu overwhelming in a good way offering a fantastic variety of pizzas including traditional tastes and unique specialty options making it hard to choose just one also they have great vegetarian whole wheat substitute glutenfree options that sparked my curiosity and i looked for help from the servers in the restaurant they seemed disinterested the menu knowledge was and the recommendations felt unhelpful order eat go for antipasti i ordered bruschetta the chopped tomatoes olives were well seasoned with herbs garlic the cream of tomato soup tangy creamy paired with fresh baked bread was an perfect appetizer before our meal perfect start now lets talk about the pizza i decided to try their signature pizzarompipalle a classic margherita paired with spicy meat sauce coriander and chilies the crust was thin crispy the sauce flavorful and the toppings fresh and generous making each bite a delightful experience for mains i tried the zucchini risotto and omg the rice was cooked to perfection al dente the creamy texture of the arborio rice combined with the natural sweetness of the pumpkin mama mia to top it all off i couldnt resist trying their homemade chocolate brownie with ice cream for dessert a perfectly baked fudgy brownie with a crunch from the walnuts paired with softserve gelato was the perfect end to our meal overall fire ice pizzeria is a mustvisit for anyone who loves pizza authentic italian food their commitment to quality is something to praise i cant wait to try more of their menu grazie per lesperienza,Positive

nice pizzas being in nepal its quite complicated to find some of them and here they prepare it relly fine i will come back for sure,Positive
the dining area was a bit congested and i would have preferred chairs instead of stools and benches prices were expensive imo the lasagna tasted good but nothing special pasta sheets were a bit unevenly cooked some places had a bit more chew to it than the rest i would have preferred more sauce between the pasta sheet the price was over priced on par with the serving of food imo the mocktail was too sour for my taste second visit though the pizza was pricey it was one of the best i had the base was soft and crunchy but flat imo i would have preferred to have some structure to it plenty of condiments the sauce was slightly sweet and went well with other condiments the sausage was disappointing unfortunately the pizza was really cheesy and so far it has been the only place where i vot stringy cheese,Positive
lasagne here is really good must try food pizza was average canzone was also okayish pasta was really good worth a try if you want to try some new food items,Positive
good pizza and best affogato,Positive

ich war drei wochen vor ort und habe das restaurant als gelungene abwechslung zur typischen nepalesischen kuche empfunden schones ambiente sehr netter und pfiffiger service und sehr leckere und hochwertige speisen und getranke gemischtes publikum bei durchaus etwas hoheren preisen die aber in relation absolut passend sind,Positive

nothing can beat their food quality so consistent fresh and out of this world must try when in kathmandu,Positive
food was just ok waited really long mins for food although people before us got food first servers were very polite and nice though maybe management needs to look at ways to help chef during rush hours,Positive

we were served burnt leftover pizza and eggs on stale bread tost very disappointed this place lack professionalism even though the owner came to talk to us and refund all the money and compliment my daughter with an icecream we left all the refunded money as tips to very un professional staff the dont deserve another visit dont go there if you speak nepali and if you look like nepali they judge you by your face and the language you speak otherwise i see no reason to serve burnt leftover pizza and bread to toast i dont know who made that decision either lazy staff or the management but for a hungry costumer healthy testy food in comfortable friendly environment is the most important thing not an apology i guess they dont need local business support the server even told us not to feed my daughter the muffin i bought from next door himalayan and my wife had to stop feeding her even though she was hungry and refused to eat their burnt pizza such a horrible place to be chao,Positive
been to italy the pizzas here are better than there been my most favourite forever,Positive
love de pizza n barhasingha g atmosphere,Positive
a great place for authentic pizza always get a table staff quick food fast pizza excellent one to keep on your list for visiting kathmandu,Positive
having been one of annamarias very first customers in jan whilst living in nepal i was really excited to return to fi and see if the pizzas lived up to my memories yes the pizzas were still good and the choice expanded greatly a crisp base a decent size and a nice amount of topping the bruschetta was also fresh and used good quality tasty tomatoes however the evening was let down somewhat by the curt and rather surly service by indira also sadly the tiramisu was a huge disappointment it needed a stronger coffee flavour and there was not even the merest hint of white rum that it supposedly contained maybe it was just an off night,Positive
le restaurant italien emblematique de thamel ou l on se retrouve avec plaisir apres un trekking ou une visite dans la vallee de kathmandu le personnel est poli et efficace et la cuisine est un vrai regal avec un grand choix de pizzas grand format des salades delicieuses sans parler des desserts,Positive
pizzas tasted yummy here we liked that its thin crusted they have a wide selection of food and drinks but the aglio olio carbonara is normal the restaurant is a popular spot for tourists and their pricing is very reasonable will definitely come back for their pizzas,Positive
i have never been offered separate seasonings when eating pizza but after i tried the pizza i knew why unfortunately it was tasteless my wifes pasta was just as poorly seasoned we had really imagined it would be different,Positive
amazing if youre going to have pizza while in kathmandu this is the place to go,Positive
ive gotta say this is the best italian food that ive found in kathmandu thus far i had a pasta carbonara for dinner and it was quite alright the atmosphere was also authentic so if you wanna enjoy some italian food go here,Positive

it is very good the pasta and pizza was very delicious it is very recommended to all of you to take a try,Positive
it is a late review i visited the place with two other friends on march this year heard good things about the restaurant online before traveling to nepal and wanted to explore it ourselves it was overall a good experience the ambience was nice they got a good number of different options on the menu one of my friends follows a strict dietary choice yet we found something to suit us all the pizza we ordered tasted good the service was good and friendly too the price may seem a bit high on the scale however considering everything it was a good spend it rained a lot that evening that added a special charm to the atmosphere of the dinner we had there i would recommend the place,Positive
i had an amazing handmade icecream here,Positive
beautiful vibes and so yumm pizza,Positive

pizza was really nice,Positive
the place is so amazing the potato chips and mojeto is a must and great the pizza is so delicious and amazing but they need to put more souce and cheese souce is like light in pizza but still worth to come and eat again we add more souce to the pizza and they charge us which should be free its a tomato souce little bit expansive but worth it,Positive
pizza base needs improvement kind of soggy and portion of meat in pizza should be more one small piece of salami in a slice of pizza is not heard of or see anywhere,Positive
the pizza dough is super i liked their thin crunch type of pizza slice which is amazing worth eating there,Positive
tastewise it same as roadhouse pizza pizza was good obviously but rs for lemon sprite ice and few mint leaves mojito is crazyyy had to try anyway to check if there is something special about it nope its the same as the one you get at half of the price and why dont you have ketchup too fancy for ketchup eh,Positive

the pizza was ok not the best i had but decent the service was not so great and it took a long time for the pizza to come the atmosphere was a little noisy and the temperature too hot end of may dont like to sound whining it was ok but not great,Positive
worst place that i ever been i was waiting for someone so i just ordered fresh juice the price was the service was terrible the waiter girl was constantly looking so awkwardly i couldnt even stand sitting there for min even didnt finish my whole drink the service people need to be humble enough to welcome guest not like this worst place for service,Negative
the pizza was delicious the place is a bit congested but its fine,Positive
this restaurant is the top pizza parlor in town offering around varieties of pizza with authentic italian flavors besides pizza they serve delicious traditional italian dishes like pasta and spaghetti bolognese making it a mustvisit for italian cuisine lovers,Positive
a great place to grab a pizza or pasta meal nepali offerings also available its a busy bustling place with a vibrant atmosphere staff are busy but efficient and friendly consistently good food,Positive
best pizza we ever had,Positive
the pizza here is average unfortunately a pizza not to come back for weve been here twice because of an appointment unfortunately the dough is too dry and there is a lack of seasoning the second time we were here it was unfortunately a disaster the pizza was even drier it tasted like nothing we suspect that because the place was too full the pizzas lost a lot in a hurry we had to wait longer for the pizzas when it was less busy it is very loud and very warm in the restaurant despite the air conditioning you can pay by card there is parking in front of the door,Negative
the crust was crunchy and the toppings were plentiful was this the best pizza ive ever had no but it is also a nice alternative to all of the momo and thalis that im sure you are all having here the place was quite full with both tourists and locals in attendance,Positive
really enjoyed the food mocktails and icecream here well located in the shopping district near aloft hotel star service,Positive
really nice place with pizza like in europe the restaurant is also very nice and not to busy,Positive
pastas and pizzas were excellent,Positive
very good food and nice services,Positive
a great downtown place in thamel stands out from the rest with its history and on point service we were ushered in by a very attentive and hands on concierge and the experience was just wonderful we tried their ettore pizza followed by a calzone and their signature dessert amore mio with ice cream i loved how airy the bread was and all fluffy in the crust a very satisfying pizza indeed the calzone was the highlight for us the stuffing was bloody good the amore mio was basically a small calzone with what seemed like a nutella type stuffing went great with the ice cream id certainly recommend it to those visiting the vibe of the place is very laid back cozy and welcoming,Positive

i recently had the pleasure of dining at this remarkable restaurant and i must say it exceeded all of my expectations from the moment i walked through the door i was greeted with warm smiles and a genuine sense of hospitality from the very owner a very handsome man sorry to say ana maria this restaurant run by an english family offers a delightful fusion of italian and international cuisine creating a truly unique and unforgettable dining experience the menu is a culinary masterpiece showcasing an array of mouthwatering dishes that beautifully blend the flavors and ingredients from both cultures each dish is expertly crafted with precision and love resulting in a symphony of flavors that dance on your palate the attention to detail is impeccable and its evident that the chefs take immense pride in their creations the ambiance of the restaurant is nothing short of magical the cozy and inviting atmosphere instantly transports you to a different world where time seems to stand still the tastefully decorated interior coupled with soft lighting and soothing music creates an intimate and romantic setting that is perfect for any occasion not only is the food exceptional but the service is equally outstanding the staff is knowledgeable attentive and always ready to provide recommendations or answer any questions you may have their passion for what they do shines through in their attentive and friendly demeanor making you feel like a valued guest throughout your entire dining experience one cannot talk about this restaurant without mentioning the delightful selection of wines and spirits the carefully curated wine list boasts a variety of options that perfectly complement the diverse flavors of the dishes whether youre a wine connoisseur or simply enjoy a good glass of vino youll find something to suit your taste in conclusion this restaurant is a hidden gem that deserves all the praise it receives and more the combination of italian and nepali cuisine the cozy and inviting atmosphere and the impeccable service make it a mustvisit for any food lover if youre looking for a unique and delightful dining experience look no further trust me you wont be disappointed,Positive

food as always nice but for summer time felt bit crowded and hot would be nice to get some cool air while we enjoy our company and fooddrinks,Positive
id heard so much about this place and everyone constantly recommended it good pizzas for sure we really enjoyed the soft yet crunch base however the place is a bit too pricey good place for a nice dinner and i would still recommend if youre in the mood for some italian food to cut through the thalis and momos,Positive
lovely pizzas,Positive
best pizza in kathmandu,Positive
first off looking at the crowd in the restaurant one may think its a really good restaurant but that really is not the case once shown to the table you are not asked about your order until you call someone to come and take the order we had ordered garlic focaccia bread first and it was good but most of the pieces had no garlic on them when approaching the manager about it they just gave us garlic oil instead of providing us with minced garlic okay after that we had a half and half pizza one side margherita and the other side i dont remember but was just two lines below margherita on the menu and it was very mediocre give that it was a neapolitan pizza restaurant i was expecting there to be fresh mozzarella or cut up mozzarella instead of the grated kind after that we had gnocchi in a butter sauce which was actually pretty good and then we had a aglio e olio pasta dish which was completely and trust me when i say completely it was literally just pasta and olive oil no garlic or parsley or chilli flakes taste to it and this resulted in us asking for a sauce to go with it after that we party of three were still quite hungry so we ordered arrabbiata past and again the tomato sauce was really bland and kind of put us off the fresh orange juice was quite good but it was not cold at all and also it is not rocket science to make a good fresh orange juice i do not blame the managers or the service staff at all in this the owners and chefs need to work together to make a better cohesive menu and to educate staff in managing the restaurant,Negative
good food and friendly staff,Positive
nice pizza with nice atmosphere by the tridevi temple a pizza with two flavours is available for ordering love their sun dried tomato,Negative
place was buzzing but service was good pizzas were excellent highly recommend,Positive
good gluten free pizza the texture is a little different to a regular pizza but the taste is nice its good to find a gluten free pizza in asia both pictures are gluten free i went back cause i liked it,Positive
great pizza great staff,Positive
salad and a parma ham pizza tasty with a wholewheat crust option fast service large windows allow a lot of fresh air nice atmosphere but feels rushed the bill looks very unprofessional and no prices vat etc shown so you cant check the bill,Negative

best pizza in town top service perfect for lunch not for dinner though because of the benches,Positive
starters crostini mushroom with cheese and cherry tomatoes mains margherita and rompipalle dessert chocolate walnut brownie with soft served icecream portions were all fulfilling however the sauce in rompipalle was bit bland it did not have that spicy meat sauce flavour,Positive
clasica pizzeria si vas a comer otra cosa piensalo mejor el lugar es muy bonito agradable limpio buena atencion y buenos precios,Positive
bonne pizza biere fraiche service un peu long,Positive
great selection of pizzas with a thin crust well prepared and cooked atmosphere also quite good situated at a very central place in kathmandu,Positive
the food was really tasty and portion sizes were perfect the staff were helpful and respectful the atmosphere was buzzing,Positive
the food is usually great here was visiting after long didnt find it upto the mark,Negative
la pizza etait vraiment delicieuse et le service a emporter assez rapide le prix est quand meme beaucoup trop cher dommage,Positive
good taste and open area to walk,Positive
very expensive,Negative
nice restaurant very clean friendly service fresh pressed juice and the pizza,Positive
nice restaurant very clean friendly service fresh pressed juice and the pizza wow thin tasty best i had in italy oh i am in nepal really good worth to try,Positive
its a nice experience for of us until we paid the bill we paid by cash and counted money times before gave it to a staff a few mins later staff came back and told us that the money was not enough total bill r we were so sure that we gave pieces of note the rest were notes but they brought back for us to recount it had only pieces of note left we added more money to end the discrepancy be warned if paying by cash better go to cashier and count the money with cashier,Negative
never order pizza with spinich and zucini tastes terrible went there with a veg friend thought of trying something newwhich turned out very bad i am sure other pizza would be nice,Negative
pizza is good but could develop more been here and years ago and then now just last week didnt feel it changed too much,Positive
fire and ice pizzeria is one name that everyone would remember when it comes to pizza multiple occasions have visited them for their pizza other food like lasagne etc it is a must to try when you are in kathmandu and even convenient if you are in and around thamel ambience i feel it needs more space as its mostly crowded the staff are good,Positive
excellente pizza italienne,Positive
the best italian food ive had in asia dont miss if youre in kathmandu and fancy pizza lovely atmosphere good drinks selection and great pizzas,Positive
i love to have pizza at fire and ice,Positive
nce restaurant and friendly staffs,Positive
fantastic i love it fire and ice restaurant is best choice in nepal for pizza and italian food,Positive
its one of the best place for pizzas lots of options to choose from pizzas here are really good beside pizza there are lots of other options available as well like pastas lasagna dumplings salads etc menu price is on higher side the place is usually crowded with tourists as well as locals free parking coupon provided for visiting customers,Positive
i wouldnt really say their food is authentic i ordered the prosciutto pizza and it was definitely not real prosciutto the lasagna was pretty minimal on the ragu and the cheese the waiter forgot my order of beer but still it was a nice place and the pizza itself had a good base and texture on the expensive side response to the owner id request that if youre serving different types of prosciutto then please be more clear on the menu i would say its worth debating if you say theres only one type of lasagna in italy for me and according to the types i like there i felt it was minimal on the ragu and cheese for the owners response below my review im curious as to why he felt the need to defend his food only versus the gaps in service i faced i had to call multiple waiters to get another round of beer and the waiter mixed up orders between tables and caused some confusion,Positive
wow one of the most overrated places ive been the food is sent out within min of ordering meaning that basically everything is preprepped i ordered a spaghetti bolognese and some pizzas including their signature fire and ice the spaghetti was mediocre and the pizza was horrendous soggy unsalted goop that wasnt even cut properly dont come here the signature fire and ice was even more bland and the worst thing we ate that day beware,Negative
this is the best pizza in thamel i would go back dont expect italy but its super good for kathmandu,Positive
gorgeous venue the outdoor terrace overlooks a beautiful courtyard we came for pizzas and tried out a bunch they are good however some of the recipes that should pack a lot of flavor eg la ciccia caramelized onion and sausage felt a bit dull but maybe it was just that one batch,Positive
food service and atmosphere are all good gave star because the seatings were not so comfortable,Positive
the penne,Positive
amazing pizza tasye,Positive
good place for pasta,Positive
we love the pizza here the thamel location was closed so we made a special trip to this location it did not disappoint much less crowded same great product also the small mall where it is located was fun to explore dont miss the ice cream,Positive
love this place with good food good ambience n vibes good service and very nice staff did i mention good pizzas,Positive
pizzas and lasagne are good similar to thamel the place was quite busy during dinner time and a bit long wait for food i felt like the service could have been better the main hall was very hot and humid dont know about other sitting areas they also have an outdoor sitting space,Positive
felt like pizza for the first time great ambience good service just everything you need,Positive
you will just love it here pizza perfect atmosphere perfect service perfect great place to hang out and click beautiful pictures,Positive
ive been a regular at fire ice and always enjoyed the food but today was very disappointing we saw cockroaches on two different tables right in front of the staff who reacted casually and didnt seem to care ive attached a video showing more cockroaches on the floor clearly a serious hygiene issue also the staff wasnt helpful or willing to make basic customizations to our food really hoping the management takes this seriously and improves both cleanliness and service,Negative
located within international club the original fire and ice has been brought in this beautiful setting with the same original taste,Negative
ive been coming to fire ice for many years and have always appreciated the food and overall experience unfortunately todays visit was extremely disappointing and raises serious hygiene concerns we saw three cockroaches on the table itself two on the first table we sat at and another on the second table we moved to both incidents happened right in front of the waiters yet the response was disturbingly casual one simply offered a quick apology and seemed completely unbothered as if this was nothing new im also attaching a video that shows cockroaches crawling on the restaurant floor which further highlights how unhygienic the environment has become this is completely unacceptable for a food establishment i sincerely hope the management takes this issue seriously and implements immediate pest control and sanitation measures on another note waiters over here too are not cooperative or emphatic while requesting for few modifications over pizza or any other food items,Negative
never order bolognese pasta here it tastes like really bad keema noodles with nepali tomato achaar and the pollo pizza literally tastes like roti with saltless potatoes as toppings and barely any chicken the service here is also really bad we had to ask for water and the pizza dressings despite being a pizzeria they didnt provide us anything to put on it we had to ask for it its worse than any restaurant ive been inthe only thing good about this place is that it is in the premises of international club thats about itcame here with high expectations and going with disappointment,Negative
as regulars in fire ice our recent experience at the jhamshikhel branch was not only disappointing but truly upsetting we ordered two pastas a carbonara and a pomodoro unfortunately both dishes were a letdown the carbonara contained pork that had an unpleasant almost spoiled smell and both pastas were extremely dry and lacked flavor this was completely unexpected given the standards fire ice is known for we sent the carbonara back and even after getting a new one it was still bad not like how it used to be however what followed was even worse being loyal fans of the nutella crepe with ice cream a dessert weve enjoyed countless times at fire ice thamel we were shocked when it arrived with melted ice cream that tasted sour and off clearly indicating it had gone bad we immediately raised the concern with the staff but instead of acknowledging the issue they insisted that the chef had tasted it and claimed it was fine we politely requested that they replace it without the ice cream they refused stating the kitchen was closed we then asked for a refund for the clearly inedible dessert but again they flatly refused with no effort to resolve the situation or offer any form of compensation despite explaining that we had just had the same dessert at the thamel outlet the day before which was excellent as always and clearly knew the difference the staff continued to be dismissive and unhelpful we hope the management takes this feedback seriously as customer loyalty should never be taken for granted,Negative
writing a review because the wait staff truly impressed me with their attentiveness after a heavy pizza id ordered a tiramisu for dessert which was delicious but was picking out most of the biscuit layer as i was full by that point and wanted to enjoy just the cream a waiter noticed and stopped to ask me if there was anything wrong with the tiramisu i told him no and that i was just full and that the tiramisu was indeed delicious but i was really impressed that he bothered to check in and make sure i was happy with my dessert i rarely come across such attentive service in kathmandu so this was a pleasant surprise plus the sanepa branch is just beautiful i really love the red walls and mosaic tiles,Positive
the staff and location are lovely but the pizza itself was mediocre especially for the hefty price ive had better in nepal,Positive
quality pizza and a good place to spend time conversing with friends a foreign staff even gave us some pizza to try for a new flavor their working on,Positive
last order last order last order last order sir last order this is what we were constantly heckled with as soon as we sat down a whole hour before closing time and a good half an hour before their actual last order time the staff here really need some training they act like they do not even want to serve you and would rather go home oh and they will also force feed you the bill and figuratively kick you out let the people eat in peace and enjoy their food and company ffs,Negative
the pizza is so mediocre they gave us scrambled eggs with spaghetti in the name of carbonara and when confronted said we make authentic carbonara with no cream so you will inevitably be served scrambled eggs for hospitality for food and for drinks,Positive
food average not so good not so bad atmosphere quite goodbut service worst their service is selective and depends on the bill amount of your table if youre in group or order more expensive foods youll be respected and treated with good service else if youre thinking of having one pizza and a dessert only then my friend dont even expect of being acknowledged that you exist,Negative
the pizza was amazing some of the best ive had in south asia the dough was cooked well and crispy bust still a little chewy,Positive
good food,Positive
the staff were too busy to serve us the food was nothing great or outstanding and even the temperature was not controlled some tables had no access to fans,Positive
being inside the international club its a pretty comfortable environment so that makes it a lot easier for this location to do well but the food and the service is on par with the original fire and ice and it tastes great,Negative
i must say the pasta was absolutely juicy and tasty the outdoor sitting under sun during cold weather was very memorable nice place to sit with friends and family,Positive
delicious food cozy atmosphere and excellent service the pizzas at fire and ice sanepa are authentic and full of flavor the staff were friendly and efficient and we were impressed by how smoothly everything ran with the help of their ims software highly recommend for a great dining experience,Negative
kathmandu is lucky to have the mediterranean gem,Positive
their bolognese is still as awesome as the one i had at their thamel branch back in,Positive

ive visited this place multiple times but with each visit the quality seems to decline the service isnt as good the atmosphere feels off and overall it just doesnt meet the expectations it once did the service isnt as attentive the atmosphere feels off and the overall experience just isnt what it used to be its disappointing to see the decline as it once had great potential i really hope they make improvements to bring back the quality that initially made this place enjoyable,Negative
ordered a carbonara and was thoroughly disappointed there was scrambled egg in it chef will know what went wrong the restaurant came highly recommend by locals,Positive
our hungry eyes always drag us to this famous pizza restaurant we love the pizzas and the hot chocolate it is always clean and in the heart of city the pizza is fully an italian style and is best served compared to any other fire ice pizzas are the best,Positive
ive only had pizza here and its good nothing special and its similar to other pizzas you can find in this price range the environment is bit noisy if you plan to sit inside but sitting outside watching the sunset having those slices of pizza is an amazing experience recommended,Positive
the interior decor really gives the italianish vibe to the restaurant the concept of the color of nepal flag as interior decor is so good i had ettore and al forno and both were just amazing,Positive

beautiful restaurant in the club they have seating indoor as well as outdoor service is quick pesto spaghetti was amazing the bruschetta was really good especially the olive one aglio olio spaghetti is not worth ordering even once the garlic oil is great all the vegetarian pizzas that we tried were great the variety of pizzas is insane the chocolate mousse and soft serve were great too tiramisu was good but ive had better the lemon iced tea was phenomenal definitely visit if youre in kathmandu,Positive
i had a fantastic experience the atmosphere was truly remarkable creating a welcoming and vibrant environment that enhanced our meal the pizza was delicious featuring a wellbalanced flavor and fresh ingredients what stood out the most was the exceptional customer serviceattentive friendly and genuinely caring overall it was a great dining experience and i highly recommend it for both the ambiance and the service,Positive
fire and ice is one of my go to pizza places and it has never disappointed me the panini that they serve is really good as well the ambience of this place is nice and has a garden space as well,Positive
used to be the best place to get italian food,Negative
there is a large garden nearby so it is a place where you can watch performances and the atmosphere is good i ate carbonara with eggs and i thought it was a healthy and fresh idea i was satisfied with both the taste and nutrition,Positive
best place for pizza and pasta as we all know from thamel outlet it is same here too safe option to choose to lunch or dine the quality of the food is always good,Positive
we went to the newly renovated international club for lunch ordered lamericana and ettore along with some chilled beer everything was okay nothing special the beer could have been better if served in a chilled glass,Positive
dont believe what the locals tell you go to pizza square instead fire and ice is a charmless restaurant with a mediocre understanding of pizza for example a calzone came with chunks of boiled egg when the egg should have been melted into the cheese and filling the chef clearly boiled and chopped an egg and slapped it onto the pizza en route to the oven the other pizzas were generally flavourless insipid even the staff were friendly in person but very rude when we rang them after the meal when one of us got very bad food poisoning runs to the toilet in hours before we even said what we ordered the stubbornly insisted it wasnt their fault i instead recommend pizza square in patan whose gourmet and affordable pizzas and excellent service will satisfy your appetites,Negative
pizza was crunchy and delicious,Positive
i am a huge lover of the nutela crepes in fire and ice usually today i had them and they barely put any nutela in the crepes the chocolate sauce whatever it was got stuck in my teeth furthermore the lady said they dont validate parking for deserts and drinks this seems a little too stingy in my opinion overall just a disappointing experience,Negative
i used to love pizzas from fire n ice thamel i tried the new spot in international club the pizza was very disappointingwe couldnt even finish it,Positive
chill place for pizza and pasta,Positive
most overrated restaurant waiters always look angry very bad customer service no air conditioning super average or sometimes below par food,Negative
i ordered the melanzane with pineapples and my friend ordered the ettore both were really good enough to last for lunch the next day which is always awesome very nice host and other staff members were kind as well not pictured but i also ordered the tiramisu which was the perfect size and really good would come back again outdoor seating is nice and the ambiance of the international club at night is very relaxing,Positive
pizzas,Positive
bad attitude of service person staff why we ordered pizza yards back side of pool they served in takeaway pack we decided move inside and enjoy those pizza suddenly one waiter came to us and said outside drinks is not allowed here we just order coffee at pool which was half of cup remain we replied ok from next time we will take care of this it was not our intention after one minute again other waiter came to us and said same things i think this is human and social understanding matter why they raised that drinks issues again and again while we are enjoying family time if you care that much why didnt u served pizza with plate and knife if it was not possible then why u didnt mention before take order make sure everything before sale your food our intention was not that your staff are too rude and less manner with customer i dont want to recommended this outlet anymore,Negative
not a bad,Negative
one of the finest pizza place in the town a neoclassic aesthetic place built around rana regime didnt find any napkins on the table but overall the food atmosphere parking were good,Positive
the best pizza in kathmandu in a beautiful garden and really good ice cream just next door,Positive
large and good pizza in sanepa,Negative
dear anna as a food enthusiast ive been enjoying pizzas at your lovely pizzeria for over two decades and im grateful for the consistent quality and service however i have a request for your international club patan branch please consider improving the air conditioning despite spending thousands of rupees on each visit its uncomfortable to sit near the limited aircoolers yet disheartening to see your hardworking staff including the waiters and the lady at the counter fanning themselves with bare hands against the high summer heat and work pressure adding a few ceiling fans and acs would greatly enhance the dining experience as well as healthier working environment for your staff both vital to the business thank you best regards a loyal customer,Positive
good food love the food there but no customer service it was hot as hell no fansno ac just coolers and the attitude of the waiters take it or leave i feel places like these should leave a benchmark for others to follow they dont respond to suggestions very disappointed today,Positive
good pizza,Positive
had a nice pizza there,Positive
service good,Positive
good ambience,Positive
hands down the best in nepal roadhouse and this place both seem to be on a tie for me but ambience wise this wins,Positive
good food and a very good ambience,Positive
i cant deny that the food at fire and ice is tasty but the quantity of ingredients used and the portion sizes has definitely decreased significantly at this spot unsure if its the same at the original location in thamel but it just seems that way here food is good environment is good service is a bit on the slower side parking available at the back,Negative
the pizza is great relying on foodmandu to deliver it is fn hopeless it took mins to deliver after it was picked up were mins away totally cold had to heat it in frypan hmm,Negative
always a great experience with the best pizzas,Positive
amazing experience here its worth every penny,Positive
this fire and ice is situated in a beautiful old palace grounds there is inside and outside seating arrangements the staff is friendly and well mannered we went for coffee and crepes it was delicious perfect to the point,Positive
a vintage old rana building complex built definitely in english colonial time lots of parking place playground for kids and last not least like awaited from this meanwhile an institution for italian cuisine very well done pizzas and pastas whereas the pasta would have been better if it was done al dante the service team needs to get briefings and couchings,Positive
this restaurant offers a great dining experience with delicious dishes and attentive service however we recommend avoiding the weekend rush as it can get very crowded and noisy,Positive
good authentic pizzas,Positive
our experience at the restaurant wasnt ideal we arrived at am and inquired about the closing time which we were told was we hurriedly placed our order only to learn that they would accept orders only until the staff began rearranging furniture at and making noise while we were still eating which disrupted our meal we felt that given the restaurants stated closing time of such activities could have been postponed until later despite our attempt to place another order at we were informed that no further orders would be accepted while we understand that the restaurant adheres strictly to its policies we expected more flexibility and better service especially considering the premium prices as guests we anticipated a higher level of hospitality and understanding of our needs,Positive
the choice to stay indoors or outdoors facing the lawn ups the atmosphere of this outlet of firice and makes it childfriendly too,Positive
the food and the pricing is very appealing had the soup and pizza and it was very delicious the place was packed on a tuesday evening seems to be very popular with the local crowd though i hear their other restaurant thamel location is supposedly even better the location where this restaurant is located is a heritage place so that adds to the charm of the experience,Positive
lovely place lovely food lovely staff cant wait to visit again,Positive
always a great place for pizza and their chips,Positive
food is good but not worth the price but if you consider the ambience and service maybe its worth it,Positive
located in the best place always here for the pizza and tiramisu,Positive
easily one of my favourite places in ktm for a good italian meal,Positive
the ambience is awesome the whole complex consists of a big gardenopen space huge parking area fire and ice pizzeria himalayan java coffee nenepal hand made artisan jewellery store silk icecream and many more the ambience is just wow with peaceful area with lots of open space for kids,Positive
good food good service amazing ambience with lots of parking,Positive
great food great atmosphere and great service,Positive
i have been going to the fire and ice location in thamel for two years i only recently discovered the lasagna polenta etc definitely recommend this dish if you crave a taste of home brought back good memories,Positive
beautiful atmosphere delicious pizza,Positive
it was the first time i visited fire and ice pizzeria the wait staff were quite active and quick the pizza we had was delicious the place is bigger with three different places the seating is comfortable and peaceful it also feels private good to visit with your friends family or a date,Positive
always a great place for pizza and lasagna taste is very consistent no matter how many times youve been there,Positive
wow pizza wow sandwich wow italian food just tastes like a wow so tasty so delicious and so creamy and mouth watering just wow wow wowwww,Positive
good food,Positive
excellent,Positive
amazing pizza,Positive
highly recommend very good food and atmosphere,Positive
food is good but service is a problem it is not able to handle a house full crowd,Positive
ordered a pesto pizza regina they brought us the pesto after we finished half of the pizza management does not care about customer feedback bad experience,Negative
fire and ice in sanepa international club no need to go to thamel for the people of lalitpur,Positive
had a positive experience at the thamel franchise previously i had high expectations but i was greatly disappointed by the taste of the carbonara the veg lasagna didnt quite satisfy me and it lacked the desired harmony between the sauce and vegetables the predominant taste was of spinach and zucchini ambiance the exterior had a cozy feel while the interior was of a familyoriented atmosphere service the service was reasonably prompt but i wasnit particularly impressed asked for water twice and didnt get it thamel fire and ice,Positive
the most overrated restaurant expensive without any taste pizza had no toppings pasta was bland ambiance was okish,Negative
they serve one of the best gourmet pizza in kathmandu i especially love their signature spicy rampopelli pizza the new branch in international club is just as good couldnt say enough do visit recommended,Positive
nice pizza nice place,Positive
fire and ice always has good pizzas,Positive
good for outing,Positive
pizza was dry and not as tasty as i thought for the price we pay we expect a higher standard,Negative
another example of focusing on ambience and ignoring the food quality i think the name should be ice and ice pizzeria as the staffs are so cold without a smile the owner should work on both food and service,Negative
the mansion is finally ready and what a beauty she is a conservation masterpiece with fine italian food buono et grazie,Positive
yummy pizza with good atmosphere,Positive
overall the food is only okay the pizzas in thamel outlet used to be much better than here the place has both indoor and outdoor seating good vibes greenery and a nice atmosphere i really wished the pizzas to be very good and they specialize in it spaghetti was a complete disappointment,Positive
the place is a wonderful location with gardens and a beautiful building shared space with other businesses we ordered hawaiiantunaquatro fromaggila marina best flavored pizza whole wheat crusts available on all pizza was a bonus most of which were not upto the fireice standards spaghetti lasagna and risotto were good seating arrangements could be made more comfortable but taking in mind that this is a new establishment there is much scope for improvements,Positive
it was a nice white house pizza experience,Positive
basic food ambience is good food,Positive
fire and ice serve premium pizzas i like the ambiance too,Positive
fire ice has always been the talk of the town when it came to pizzas but the new location really disappointed the place is nice but not convenient it was raining and parking was at a distance without any shade for protection against the rain the parking wasnt free either free for himalayan java but not for fire and ice the service was really bad with the staff banging the coke bottle on the table and not serving water until after the meal and after requesting it for multiple times they werent so busy either the pizza dough was and always is mindblowing however maybe unluckily the tomato sauce was not good at all and because of that most of the food we ordered turned out to be mediocre since all of them used the same tomatoes,Positive
so bad service that you feel unwelcomed no one smiles food wasnt good small table,Positive
beautiful new location the food is simply excellent,Positive
lovely place in the premises of international club sanepa ambience is very good had ettorechicken pizza cafe latte and a frappe and everything was very yumm service is really fast and i had a good time with my friend will visit again soon i would recommend this to friends and family,Positive
i was organizing my grandsons birthday dinner with some of my family members as always we were very pleased with the food drinks and everything my three grandchildren and the adults all enjoyed the evening,Positive
good place to take some beer and enjoy a nice pizza,Positive
you enter a beautiful garden amid historic welllit buildings menu and prices promise fine dining the glass of wine for nearly to rs arrives in a cheap and chunky glass that looks as if its off bhat bhatenis shelves no one will arrange your table no table mat cutlery rolled into a napkin is dumped on your table without a word the salami pizzas i had on two occasions were dry without any magic and with substandard salami from which emanated an unpleasant smell the food and service would be okay for an eatery but here you pay for fine dining really so this is a good place if you dont mind low standards and paying much for those,Negative
location wise nested within the international club in sanepa the best pizzaria in kathmandu has now a super apot in jhamel as well i had visited the parent hub in thamel a day ago which is still the best of two sanepa will give it a run for the money considering its location in sanepa l while the waiter just brought me when i had ordered two i didnt mind waiting as the outside sesting are is just next to the common garden overall give it a try and let me know,Positive
really good atmosphere and really great place for a date good pizza as expected and dont order the appetizer in my photo really not worth it would visit again with friends family or a date,Positive
raw veggies in pizza flavorless and tasteless,Negative
i ate pizza pollo tomato sauce mozzarella sweet corn chicken potatpotatoes rosemary and penne al forno both are delicious i want to eat again and again,Positive
superb location,Positive
hot insideouter tabel are quite small and raining problem,Positive
new and a more scenic place but same old ambiance and taste,Positive
very slow service,Negative
authentic italian pizza and food really wanted to cone tonlalitpur area and at last they have if you love fire and ice at thamel this is much better and spacious food is stars plenty of parking space at the international club highly recommended,Positive
although somewhat pizza is expensive compare to other places in lalitpur the pizza and pasta were awesomeserving took delayed but good vibes if live musice is introduced this will be one of best places in lalitpur,Positive
staff seemed rude and judgmental body language gave it away,Negative
excited for the new location food seems the same as the one in thamel which i appreciate lovely atmosphere and will only get better as they continue to add more to the complex so fun,Positive
delightful experience having lunch here the layout of the place is spacious and the location is super the food and service is excellent the staff is very well trained and are very courteous,Positive
worst restaurant staff security,Negative
found the pizza here quite average than what i had tasted in fire and ice pizzeria thamel that might be due to my high expectations that the pizza would burst my tastebud it was average nothing new and simple,Positive
although pricy this is the best pizzeria in kathmandu and now they have a branch in sanepa first of all ample parking space in the international club complex i love the ambience this new place is designed meticulously to give you the italian feel i have no complaints of the food here and they also have their signature softeys here too very friendly staff clean bathrooms a lot of seating space indoors outdoors and also a small cafe overlooking the swimming pool,Positive
beautiful place with equally wonderful food ambiance and people,Positive
even here times in a week quite a few good menu choices tried three kinds of gnocchi burger pizza all great,Positive
one of the best pizzeria in kathmandu must go place if you like italian food the calzone is one of the best that i like in this place they serve good dessert also this new outlet in lalitpur has plenty of parking the ambience is good as well staffs are very polite and attentive id definitely advise this place if you love pizza or italian food,Positive
another great pizzeria in sanepa area at the remodeled international club great location good vibe amazing pizzas tip to management add draught beer,Positive
i had an amazing experience at bhojan griha kathmandu the heritage setting is beautiful the staff are warm and welcoming and the traditional nepali thali was delicious and filling the live folk music and cultural dance performances made the evening even more special definitely a mustvisit for anyone who wants to enjoy authentic nepali food with a cultural touch,Positive
good food with best service most expensive for normal people,Negative
very nice place combination of nepali and modern service,Positive
honestly a tourist trap but a good one priced at usd for dinner including a rice wine lots of dances from different areas which is fun and the diners joined in food was fine not the best but given the atmosphere it was worth it,Positive
really enjoy the dancing the food was really good,Positive
authentic nepali feels at a price of course but great place for dinner with family phenomenal cultural dance performances varieties of food options better than any thakali place ive been to before experience the timeless palace interiors with authentic nepali food and cultural dance,Positive
the starter included badam sadheko bhuteko makai garnished peanuts pot baked corn aloo tareko potatoes fried nepali styled momocha meat filled dumplings soup veg soup kwatti ko surwa mixed vegetable soup main course sada bhuja steamed white rice jhaneko mas ko dal split black dal flavored with jimmu khashi ko masu mutton kukhura ko mashu chicken curry sweets sikarni sweetened yogurt cream so in total per person it was rs if you arrive on time like from pm onwards theres dance cultural shows as well plus theres painting of kings which is simply wow,Positive
its a rip off their website shows something they get menu with usd for each even a year old child was charged same price as you all know kids usually dont eat much for the restaurant we reached early did not know the music time we were there only for music only food we could have eaten anywhere but the attitude the musician showed was very bad if someone offers some tips you dont accept it thats alright but never make fun of what you offered make public to show us down we paid npr rupees for dinner non vegetarian thali even they charged npr for a sprite that was totally rip off on foreigners who visit nepal apart from that people who were serving were laughing as i asked times mutton to serve this was too much i dont recommend this plan to anyone they think we are sheep who voluntarily came to them to get slaughtered i literally told on their faces while paying the bill they asked sorry but cant heal what they did to me coming to food they dont have anything else apart from aloo fry dal momo mini dry chicken greens mushroom pickle rice with mutton curry this is their menu items i paid npr rupees for dinner non vegetarian thali can you imagine i know i was scape goat now laugh at me it make sense,Negative
the manager cant handle the food critic and dont know anything about the customer service very unprofessional dont even have the the bottle water available,Negative
the menu isnt suitable for kids and theres no wheelchair access the fixed menu offered no choices and the water quality wasnt great there were no options to purchase bottled mineral water and when we brought our own the manager was rude and dismissive of our feedback while the cultural show was a nice effort more variety and options for kids and international guests would enhance the experience specially for the price paid,Positive
great place for authentic nepali cuisine in a palace years old,Positive
would not recommend evidently they dont have anything on the menu that is shown on their website we ended up paying usd each for a fixed price menu with low quality food that we didnt want i dont know if this is just for americans but it felt like we were getting swindled,Negative
this review may only be applicable to foreigners there is an excellent and varied menu on the website it is not available to foreigners we asked about it and we were told we could only have one menu quoted in us dollars which is always strange attached here interesting the locals at the table next to us had a totally different menu and food than we did foreigners are not allowed to order what they were ordering apparently the meat was much tougher than expected service was fairly flat there are no signs so you have to walk through the building and somebody was holding a speech or religious service and you have to walk through it for a price that is extremely high in nepal especially given the lack of choice available to foreigners relative to what is advertised on the site it was a very bad deal note we were here for lunch i understand there may be some evening music and entertainment and this review only applies to lunch,Negative
food awesome service awesome and ambiance awesomehighly recommended,Positive
food was not good undercooked food specially non veg items not a good place considering the price they charge enjoy your evening in thamel instead,Negative
amazing cultural experience and fantastic food,Positive
good place,Positive
great place to have dinner with your family and enjoy cultural dance,Positive
nice,Positive
everything was so great from food ambience and services would visit definitely agin when i will be back to,Positive
while visiting kathmandu this place is such a special place to visit experience nepalese food dancers music clothes from various districts of the country a cultural tour of nepal at a beautiful historical building delicious food,Positive
wunderbar mit tanz u musik in tollem ambiente,Positive
the atmosphere was warm the tables were set low with the seats it was a different experience but enjoyable food was served along side with the cultural performance its a wonderful experience thankful to our host who brought us here,Positive
what an absolutely amazing experience absolute pleasure to have experienced such culture and amazing customer service highly highly recommend,Positive
good food good dance show,Positive
the place is absolutely is a amazing place with historic buildings and cultural dance with great food i have taken my travelers for the dinnerthey enjoy the atmosphere and cultural dance of nepal its a best place to have the dinner in kathamndu,Positive
i like the services and food here with the live performace the dance was also good the people are humble and the food was tasty,Positive
a place that is perfect to experience the taste of nepal the food served here is an experience that showcases the traditional dining of nepal with live traditional dance and music to go with slightly expensive but definitely worth it you teuly wont regret dining here in addition the building where this establishment is located happens to be a historical one where teh bada gurju of the then rana rulers lived,Positive
price was too much expensive and quantity was so little the main thing was there was no option to choose which food to eat the only item in the menu was thali set with some side dishes and we should take it one by one per person really bad experience,Negative
worth it,Positive
the vibe was so good and ambiance also,Positive
beautiful place to spend a night with loved ones,Positive
the dancing the mutton the service and atmosphere were wonderful i loved the opportunity to try some wonderful nepali food while watching great dancing performances an absolute pleasure all around,Positive
i wish i could give more than stars particularly for the atmosphere the food was lovely and the staff really helpful explaining what the dishes were the music and dancers just made a great experience that much more special loved the yoghurt too,Positive
i had a farewell dinner here after a four week journey in south asia what a wonderful place and unique atmosphere lovely food,Positive
wonderful newari cultural experience beautiful atmosphere excellent food accompanied by stunning cultural dance and music performances this is one of my favorite place to bring guests from countriesi,Positive
the atmosphere is great but food quality and service standards have fallen in the recent years food was served cold and looks like the servers are not trained from a hospitality school,Positive
vinimos por la boda de un amigo y muy buen sitio tradicional,Positive
amazing place to visit with family and friendsthe hospitality was really good and impressivethe staffs were really welcomingits a must visit to explore nepali culture and food,Positive
a must visit place to experience the rich culture of nepal the place where food meets culture live performances and great ambiance,Positive
quite ambience and great food with cultural night,Positive
our nepalese culture dance and food vojan very goodi felt,Negative
they had prepared us halal meal upon our request we were a big group tho this is the most appreciated thing for a muslim struggling to find a halal place in kathmandu the nepali food here was the best compared to the other places weve eaten the staff is very friendly the atmosphere is so warm there are sitting areas with or without traditional dance show so you can choose friendly advice to wear nice socks if youre going there,Positive
i was really looking forward to my visit to bhojan griha especially since they market themselves as a place that combines nepali performance with food unfortunately both aspects fell flat the performance felt weak overall while there were a few moments where the performers genuinely seemed to enjoy themselves most of the time it was bland and lacked energy i expected a vibrant display of culture but it just didnt deliver as for the food it was nothing to write home aboutquite ordinary for the price point i was hoping for something special to complement the performance but it really missed the mark additionally the service was rushed and made it hard to engage with the staff it felt like they were more focused on turning tables than providing a good dining experience overall i left feeling disappointed bhojan griha has potential but they really need to step up both their performances and their food to match the expectations they set,Positive
overly priced restaurant where normal nepalese or a traveller on budget cant afford i would not recommend this restaurant to a budget traveller unless you are a highly paid diplomat unless you are cash rich tourist or a bigshot nepali food portions served less service staffs focused on selling the buffet menu only food tasted normal only the good part is cultural performance and the heritage house otherwise its just a overhyped restaurant,Positive
very good,Positive
had a wonderful time while i went there price is reasonable service is good,Positive
nestled in the heart of kathmandu bhojan griha offers a unique dining experience that beautifully blends tradition culture and authentic nepali cuisine housed in a yearold heritage building the restaurants rustic charm transports guests back in time making for a warm and immersive atmosphere,Positive
great ambiance and good food,Positive
perfect,Positive
a dazzling disappointment bhojan grija impresses with its inviting ambience and elegant silverware creating a warm atmosphere for diners however the food disappoints lacking depth of flavor and creativity despite its artistic presentation after waiting hours for the main courses the experience feels particularly sloppy while the attentive service adds warmth it cannot compensate for the mediocrity of the culinary offerings the saving grace is the vibrant cultural performances that entertain throughout the evening ultimately bhojan grija is a beautifully set table where the experience is more about culture than foodcome for the performances not the cuisine,Positive
turned out to be best in authentic nepali dance,Positive
wow such a wonderful events i love the environment hospitality outstanding heads up,Positive
everything was exceptional traditional food and service were excellent and atmosphere with traditional dance performances was outstanding it is a great place,Positive
not worth the dinner as i expected expectationvsreality,Positive
line hotel service at night on the way journey to ktm,Positive
very tasty food cultural dances and good atmosphere thank you barat basnet,Positive
amazing experience with my family,Positive

bhojan griha delivers an authentic taste of nepal with a menu that expertly showcases the rich culinary traditions of the himalayas from the delicate momos to the hearty dal bhat every dish is crafted with impeccable care transporting diners to the heart of nepali culture in an elegantly appointed setting,Positive
great place to experience our nepali culture the course dining was good and the cultural performances was plesently entertaining the total experience was really wholesome hope to come here again soon,Positive
no se lo recomiendo a nadie aunque le encante el folclore nepali la comida realmente mala el baile no voy a entrar a valorarlo y el senor que bueno que es increible que en el siglo se hagan estas cosas nos llevo un tour operador local,Positive
the palacelike ambiance and royal service made us feel like true royalty the authentic nepali cuisine was exquisite with each dish bursting with traditional flavors the mesmerizing music and dance performance added to the enchantment from the moment we arrived the impeccable hospitality and enchanting decor made our visit truly special highly recommended for a regal dining experience,Positive
our culture is our pride and bhojan griha try to keep by themselves for us thank you so much for such beautiful concept this place is really suit to entire family members belonging from nepal and as well tourists from outside of nepal to show our culture as well as our typical foods,Positive
all things are nice over here if you are going have a dinner enjoy it slowly you will feel better,Positive
the food was terrible and to make matters worse we found hair in our saag it was unnecessarily costly too and the dishes didnt have much authentic taste extremely disappointed,Negative
nice place for a group cultural dance rs approx per person go there for experience,Negative
it was an amazing experience to be there i was there with my family perfect for family gathering the food and hospitality was very good me and my family enjoyed it throughly will visit again soon,Positive
what used to be a good restaurant has dropped in food quality and service this was the th time we have been to this restaurant albeit our first time since before covid the quality of food dramatically dropped bland thali food that was barely warm untrained service staff and a high price tag for the foodexperience servers were rude and nonattentive we recommend checking out other restaurants in kathmandu,Positive
most disappointing dining experience in kathmandu we looked forward to enjoying the advertised entertainment and meal package with our guests who were visiting nepal for the first time however our evening took a sour turn when a group affiliated with the tourism association also dining there monopolized the use and enjoyment of the restaurant the prolonged speeches at their table delayed the entertainment causing an hourlong disruption despite our pm reservation efforts to address the situation with senior management were futile as our concerns were dismissed even when the musicians attempted to commence the performance they were abruptly silenced by members of the tourism association the tourism associations behavior displayed a profound lack of respect and an attitude of selfimportance pressuring other diners to conform to their unreasonable demands witnessing such a disregard for hospitality and basic respect was embarrassing particularly ironic given their meetings supposed purpose of promoting tourism regrettably the restaurants management failed to rectify the situation choosing instead to cater to the tourism associations selfish demands this lack of responsiveness was deeply disappointing the few appetizers that did arrive after long drawn out pauses were subpar i cannot speak for the main course as our dinner was cut short due to the selfish demands of the tourism association members without the entertainment aspect the food is definitely not worth the price tag in conclusion i would advise patrons to consider supporting other local establishments that uphold the standards of hospitality and professionalism bhojan griha is not an accurate representation of the wonderful nepalese culture cuisine and hospitality,Negative
worst dining experience in kathmandu poor management staff overpriced subpar nepali food and bait and switch no dancemusic we were so excited to have a traditional and cultural nepali experience since we were visiting from new york we prebooked this restaurant so we could see nepali dancing and music after driving hour through peak traffic for our pm reservation we come to realize that the restaurant management had seated us in a room where the tourism association was having a business meeting with members the dancemusic show was supposed to promptly start at pm however when the entertainers came on the tourism association members insisted the entertainers not perform we expressed our dismay with the staff and senior management team they failed to make any attempt to remediate the situation i spoke with senior management members and all they could say was sorry this whole situation could have easily been avoided if the management had put the tourisim association in a private room or sat us in a separate room to begin with a restaurant we had high hopes for was beyond disappointing please note that this restaurant is expensive by kathmandu standards save your money and support a local restaurant that actually appreciates and values its customers the courses we tried before leaving bhojan griha midway through were lackluster the momos were dry the popcorn was bland and lthe soup was lukewarm the lack of respect they had for their customers was appalling the irony of it all was that the tourism association bullied the tourists into leaving the restaurant and ruined our tourism experience of kathmandu,Negative
best fine dining restaurant with live cultural performances and traditional ambiance feels like star traditional restaurant in town,Positive
bhojan griha is situated within a lavish palace exuding an aura of luxury and grandeur reminiscent of a mythical and cultural treasure trove stepping into the theatrical hall guests are greeted with gentle murmurs from the courtyard setting the tone for a sophisticated dining experience the staff warmly welcomes patrons with delicate gestures adding to the anticipation of what lies ahead the highlight of the evening is the mesmerizing display of cultural dances and songs adding a unique charm to the dining affair the culinary offerings are equally delightful inviting guests to savor each dish with joy the impeccable service of the staff enhances the overall dining experience leaving a lasting impression of remarkable hospitality the restaurant owner personally engages with guests ensuring a familial atmosphere where everyone feels valued and cherished spending approximately two hours in this enchanting environment feels akin to losing oneself in a cultural village both foreign and local tourists seeking an unparalleled culinary and cultural experience the restaurant may seem pricey at first but the value offered in terms of service unlimited food and cultural entertainment surpasses any initial cost concerns its truly an exceptional package deal leaving patrons longing to return for more thank you,Positive
i recently dined at bhojan griha and regrettably my experience was far from pleasant despite the steep price of the thali set which costs around equivalent to rs the quality of the food was profoundly disappointing firstly the taste of the food was abysmal each dish in the thali set was either bland overly salty or lacked freshness for such a high price one would expect a wellprepared and flavorful meal but this was certainly not the case the overall quality of the food left much to be desired secondly the service was incredibly poor when ordering the thali set one would expect all items to be served together allowing for a cohesive dining experience instead each staff member brought out only one item at a time this disjointed service meant that by the time i received the final item of my thali set i had already finished the rest of the meal this not only disrupted the dining experience but also showed a lack of coordination and efficiency among the staff on a more positive note the restaurant does offer a cultural dance performance which adds a lively and entertaining atmosphere to the dining experience the ambiance is enjoyable and if you are interested in the cultural performances it might be worth a visit just for that however it is evident that bhojan griha primarily caters to foreign tourists the focus on ambiance over food quality and service is apparent if you are looking for an authentic and satisfying dining experience i would recommend looking elsewhere in summary while the cultural dance and atmosphere are commendable the poor food quality and disjointed service at bhojan griha make it a place i would not recommend for a meal save your money and dine at a restaurant that prioritizes both taste and service,Positive
the food was amazing we had a few traditional nepalese food in other restaurantsbut this was another leve the food was great the place is original and well maintained my wife and i had a great night and extraordinary experience highly recommend also the dessert was out this world,Positive
the experience was good and deliting,Positive
excellent food and service very nice show with music and local dancing recommended,Positive
few things off about the place the owner one manager maybe and a bartender these three people i have never seen smiling or welcoming other staffs are great and very welcoming except the three individuals,Positive
nice place and best services,Positive

a unique place for traditional lunch dinner and events,Positive
i visited bhojan griha on rd july based on the rating of the place this review is therefore a review on what to expect if you visit the place i was escorted from the gate to the steps that take you up the restaurant which kind of felt nice the setting upstairs was decent and the large open window meant that there was decent fresh cool air circulation i was asked to take off my shoes and followed the waiter water was served in brass glass and i knew it was going to be a traditional meal i washed my hands in a small mens room and the small washbasin was also made of brass outside there was a short veranda which lead to another room where one person was sitting on a duvet on the floor and giving an interview if you were to have lunch in that setting you would be sitting on the floor i was in the adjoining room where the chairs were low and so were the tables but i was not sitting on the floor the water came and gave me a set menu which at usd appeared high to me in any case i asked for the ala carte and wasnt disappointed as he reluctantly even if politely produced the menu card i ordered mixed vegetables and dal along with two chapati i also ordered a fanta the food when it came was once again served in brass ware and was fresh the fanta was served in a glass and was without fizz probably they use large bottles to save costs but this is not a cheap place so the saving is in poor taste because when you pay more you notice the descrepancies more the food tastes good and was freshly made no one asked to switch on the table fans and i just ignored the minor amiss here the waiter appeared just as i was finishing and asked if there would be anything else i requested for the bill the bill when it came struck me as slightly odd there was a service charge but the waiter was in any case hanging around waiting for more the vat was on both the basic bill and the service charge which was a bit odd i left some small tip not to disappoint the poor man who probably doesnt even get the service charge the bill was over usd which is clearly a lot for normal nepalese cuisine even if in a decent setting i am going with star,Negative

ambiente super acolhedor e com aquele charme que so se encontra nos bons cafes de viagem pedi uma pizza e honestamente superou as expectativas massa fina bem estaladica e ingredientes frescos a serio o staff foi simpatico e atento e o espaco e perfeito para uma pausa tranquila no meio da confusao de katmandu recomendo a principalmente para quem anda a procura de um bocadinho de italia no nepal,Positive
had to wait more than mins the order to be taken the waiter is not very polite,Positive
tried the spicy tuna pizza at roadhouse cafe for the first time and i must say it completely exceeded my expectations roadhouse is already known for its great pizzas but this one turned out even better than the classic chicken pizza the flavors were perfectly balanced with just the right kick of spice the space was comfortable and the overall ambience was really nice great for catching up with friends or just enjoying a good meal however one thing i felt could be improved is the water service it would be more welcoming if they offered regular drinking water as a basic courtesy currently they only serve mineral water if you order it which feels a bit off for an otherwise great dining experience overall a fantastic visit with delicious food just hoping for a little more hospitality when it comes to water service,Positive
exceptional pizza we totally recommend the roadhouse blues one also the one with chicken was really good a totally unexpected find especially in nepal very nice place you can pay by card we went two times thats how good the pizza was,Negative
we came here after looking at the reviews ambience is nice so are staffs we both ordered one pan grill breakfast and masala tea was expecting a hot breakfast but everything was cold apart from just the hash brown i didnt understand the concept of them using the hot plate which was not even hot it didnt taste as good as we had expected we have eaten way better breakfast of this kind at other places at a reasonable price but on the lighter note the masala tea was the only plus point,Positive

gostamos bastante desse restaurante tanto que viemos duas vezes comemos o frango grelhado com pure de batatas e legumes a massa da casa que e bem azeitada feita com cogumelos legumes azeitonas pretas ambos os pratos foram muito bem preparados da outra vez optamos pela pizza que estava muito gostosa ale disso tem uma boa carta de vinhos e cervejas foi uma otima opcao para variar um pouco da culinaria local recomendo,Positive

great spot if you are looking for a more american style breakfast while in kathmandu the omelette had green chili peppers giving it a delicious kick,Negative
we enjoyed the mexicana pizza and it was truly one of the best pizzas weve experienced in kathmandu the thin crust juicy toppings and rich flavor made it delightful however we felt the service could have been a bit more attentive the nighttime atmosphere was warm and inviting,Positive

this is the place for an amazing thin crust pizza situated right in the middle of my favorite part of kathmandu away from the diesel smoke pollution of the main roads this place has everything going for it the atmosphere is second to none and its amplified as soon as the sun sets in the western sky you wont find the locals here but youll spot people from round the globe conversing about their hiking tales front sided or post many delicious meals are available all within a travelers budget sample the local premium nepali beer gorkha if a portuguese man mated with a lady from nepal youd have the manchild pictured on the label with the tagline dedicated to the brave he looks as if he could be the cocky grandson of the sandeman port dude minus the famous cape enjoy,Positive
