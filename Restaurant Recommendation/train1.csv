5,The ambience of the restaurant is too good. It gives a different vibe. The food is also delicious & they provide best food in Kathmandu City. They just have to work on the air ventilation.

5,"Nice place
Nice service
Little expensive but good food and drinks"
5,Absolutely delicious! Very nice stuff and so so child friendly. We loved everything about about the place and will definitely be back.
5,"We tasted some of traditional and national plates in vegan version that we enjoyed a lot. We tasted vegan momo, peanut sadeko (cold salad with peanut) and khalija set (rice flakes with vegetables and pickeld veggies). They also have a vegan cake on the menu! The personeel is very informed about veganism. The place is on a terrace in mandala street that is a pedonal street in Kathmandu. There are also two cats, very cute that just want to be petted."
5,Very tasty! Try nepalian starters!
5,One of the few restaurants in Thamel where they seem happy to adjust to wishes. The atmosphere is so good and the stuff is very helpful and so understanding. Highly recommend!
5,Took a friend for dinner here and this place is so wholesome. The owners were kind and hospitable folks. The food was great. My personal favorite was the slice of cashew vegan cake.
5,The food was really good and super fresh. Price is reasonable. Atmosphere was very cute and staff were attentive and friendly.
5,"We visited the restaurant in the evening and enjoyed a nice view, a pleasant green atmosphere, and tasty meals. The service was great, and the staff were friendly and welcoming.

It's located on the 3rd floor, which keeps you away from the hectic street below and gives you the chance to spend a calm evening -- chatting with friends and enjoying good food."
5,"Amazing chill place, enjoyed guacamole salad and mango lassi, must visit"
5,"We absolutely loved the food and atmosphere here! We even went back multiple times. If you're looking for a cozy spot to relax, I recommend visiting in the afternoon and enjoying the sunset. And for all you cat lovers out there, there are two adorable cats here who love to snuggle up right next to you."
5,"Delicious food, incredible ambience, and excellent service highly recommend for anyone visiting Kathmandu and looking for a healthy delicious authentic cuisine to enjoy for a really good price. Roshan did a great job!"
5,"I came to this place several times, both before and after my trek, and it was the first spot I wanted to eat at when I got back.

I've tried the pesto pasta, various salads, and juices, and everything was absolutely delicious. The food tastes fresh, and you can tell they put care into the presentation also.

The space is super comfortable, all open with cozy chairs and couches. There's also the cutest cat that hangs around, which adds to the charm. The staff are really friendly, and honestly, I love everything about this place. Definitely my favorite spot in town!"
5,"Very good chilled spot. Goats cheese and beetroot salad was a bit light on goats cheese for my taste, but very fresh and tasty. That's definitely a starter rather than a main, btw. 3rd floor rooftop location means you're away from the bustle of Thamel. No music when I was there (mid afternoon), so perfect spot for reading. Nice decor, comfy sofas, loads of plants, and a super friendly, gorgeous white cat which curled up on my lap as soon as we met. Would recommend!"
5,Very good!
5,"Good food and reasonable prices. However, no view. We expected to see the street from above, but it was blocked by trees and buildings. Friendly and helpful staff."
5,Excellent customer service
1,"Me and my partner contracted gastroenteritis after eating here after lunch on May 18th 2025.
I suspect it was the chicken balls from the chicken platter. I tasted they were old chicken but assumed they'd be safe, they weren't   
As customers, we prefer fresh food and are happy to pay the price to get it. It appears forest and plate were cutting corners in this regard.
I had high expectations for this restaurant, i ate here twice, and both meals were sadly disappointing. The food lacked originality and punch. Can't remember tasting herbs or spices "
5,"Very fresh and delicious food. The service is also very good. Like the place, one of the better resto's in Thamel."
5,Excellent salads and pasta with an amazing ambience at the rooftop. Highly recommend the forest salad!
4,Nice place at Thamel
5,"vvyrh tvbh, vkl nqy vt`ym , mkhyr tvb ,

5,"We started with their cheese balls--so good! We got a table right away, drinks came fast, and the food was both quick and delicious. Definitely end with the vegan cashew dessert, it's a winner!"
5,"We were excited to have a salad post trek and Forest & Plate did not disappoint! Such nice options, and so tasty, and really generous portions! The simple dressing was delicious too. And who knew...you can get a Long Island Iced Tea (as my husband did) or other fun and strong cocktails as well as nice fresh juices. You do have to be committed to haul yourself up the stair, but once up there, it feels like you are in a tree house - such a cool atmosphere in the middle of this bustling shopping area. Definitely worth it!! The resident cat cruising around was an added bonus too!"
5,"This is an incredible place that has everything you are looking for - a wonderful location, gentle music, true atmosphere of Nepalese beauty, delicious food and perfect refreshing drinks. My favorite with ginger and mint, and the most delicious vegan momo I've ever tasted.
And of course a great people! The staff and owners greet you with a kind sincere look and friendly conversation.
This place has a real soul and you definitely want to come back here again and again. Thank you very much and definitely hope to see you next time."
5,Roof top resturant with a charming atmosphere and good food ans drinks. They are 2 cats that live there to witch is allways a plus
5,This place is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I was only in Kathmandu for two days prior to a trek but couldn't resist coming here three times. The salads are out of this world and the prices are so realistic. I leave here feeling so healthy. Highly highly recommend!!
5,"Took a group of 10 and had the most wonderful experience. Great food, great atmosphere and service. Cool location in Thamel.

Food here is very clean, greens and veggies sourced locally and washed with purified water. Staff is warm and inviting and it is open air on the top floor, with a neat look down on mandala street. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a nice treat or dinner.

Many juices and drinks on menu as well as a great bar for the harder varieties."
5,"Found down a quaint street off a main road, this place is up 3 flights of stairs, very unassuming but once inside is like a magical rainforest cafe. The food was exceptional, as was the service. The salads were clean and delicious and the pasta was also fresh and healthy. 100% recommend if you are looking for fresh options."
5,Thank you ! It was delicious
5,I've been in Nepal for several weeks now and keep coming back to this amazing place for fresh salads and clean nourishing food. Everything I've tried on the menu is delicious! Very lovely staff and a cute resident cat that loves to wander past! Highly recommend
5,"qvmh khrvnh bbynyyn, n`ym nqy t`ymmmmm"
5,Blooming marvellous. Very helpful staff. Great menu. Nice prices. What is there not to like about this place.
5,"I passed by this vegetarian restaurant, it looked nice, and it turns out they have amazing food!
I ordered an avocado salad, I almost finished it, even though I was a small eater!

And the restaurant was partial outdoor seating with a plenty of plants inside which was super relaxing"
5,"Dining area is so comfortable, nice fresh air, on the rooftop, very cosy outdoor spacious seating space - nice casual ambiance and welcoming atmosphere

Service is patient and friendly and welcoming, and they also have cute cats around too

Open kitchen can see everything being cooked , made to order, food is served Nice and warm - absolutely delicious!!

Level 4 have to walk up stairs , a bit hard to find at first

Known for their salad bar with pasta options but I opted for some of their Nepalese options
#Aalu Tama Rs 235
#Vegetarian Momo Rs 290
#Cashew Cake Rs 390

First time trying Aalu Tama-- Predominantly sour soup with a kick of hot spice, very comforting perfect for the warm weather, With beans, potatoes, bamboo shoots and lots of spices, loaded with flavour!!

I saw the other customers get a green veggie pasta which looked so creamy and delicious so might have to try that next time.

Momos were good , filling was quite spicy, well seasoned, the wrapper was nice and thin but held together nicely

Cashew cake was sensational, so creamy and smooth- was nutty and velvety like silken tofu texture and the base was so firm, warm, crunchy and nutty with dried fruits, like a granola x carrot cake mixture and had a sweetness to it which wasn't overpowering but complemented the dessert really well

Highly recommend would come back"
4,"Very good food and drinks. The service was very kind. The place is also nice except for the cat that is jumping all over the places (tables, chairs, bar counter)."
4,"Sehr gutes Essen, tolle Leute arbeiten dort, aber die Preise sind deutlich uber dem lokalen Durchschnitt!"
5,"Beautiful fresh food in an equally beautiful setting- a relaxed verdant oasis tucked away above the hustle of the city. Friendly and welcoming, we left with our bellies full and our spirits lifted. Thank you!"
5,Fantastic spot. Best dal bhat i've had during my travels in Nepal (that says a lot!). The vegan panna cotta was phenomenal!
5,"The Guacamole salad was very tasty, fresh and filling and the staff were sweethearts"
5,"Amazing Cajun Himalayan Pasta! If you're looking for flavor, carbs, chicken, and some veggies, highly recommend this dish. Food came out fast. Service was great. Highly recommend~"
5,"Amazing food at a very reasonable price for the high quality that you get, great service and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend"
4,"It's a good restaurant on the fourth floor, but there's no elevator. The food is good, the staff is polite and well-mannered, and the environment is beautiful.There is a open kitchen and you can watch the food being cooked there."
5,Nice
5,"Whenever I am in Kathmandu, I come here every day! I just love the ambience, friendly staff (and cats!), chilled vibe and great food made with fresh products. Always exactly what I need after a long flight or trekking. Thank you Forest & Plate for making my stay in Kathmandu :)"
5,Great food yummy cocktails good vegetarian
5,"Beautiful atmosphere, service and food. A tiny forest in thamel"
5,I asked AI where I should eat and this was at the top of the list. It did not disappoint incredible food and very attentive friendly staff. You can tell they genuinely care about the food and your experience.
5,"Best food & price, open kitchen, very clean"
1,Das Lokal gibt es nicht mehr - trotz der Hinweisschilder! Der Aufstieg lohnt sich also nicht!
1,If you are in anyway concerned about your health I'd say you may want to avoid This place. In all honesty we read the positive reviews and rocked up. Well the reality to the experience is a very different matter. We left. Immediately after reading some of the negative reviews and looking around I'm not surprised it was dead.
5,"Delicious food here, in a nice and quiet upstairs garden.

We had momos, a salad, cheese balls and pasta. All were absolute delicious!!

Highly reccomened this restaurant if you are in Kathmandu and you want something fresh, healthy and delicious :)"
5,Sooo good and healthy. And vibe is on point! Had the best service and it's so cozy...there was even a blanket for the colder nights here. Definitely coming back!
5,"Personale davvero super gentile e attento alle richieste del cliente, cibo buono e prezzi giusti. Molto bravi"
5,Wspaniale jedzenie i wystroj
3,"Pretty good food. Avoid the cashew cake dessert -it's like the top off a can of coconut cream shmeared on a biscuit base. Panacotta much better. Beware they charge an excess for debit card payments, even if you have a Nepali rupee card."
5,"Lovely restaurant with great fresh salads, juices and lovely staff!"
5,"Helaas ontdekte ik deze plek pas op mijn laatste dag in KTM, anders was ik zeker teruggekomen. Het eten is heerlijk en gezond. Je krijgt grote porties tegen lage prijzen en het personeel is heel vriendelijk. Daarnaast is het een leuke plek om te zitten."
5,"Awesome fresh and different food, friendly staff and nice atmosphere "
5,"Consigliatissimo!! Menu Bio, insalate buonissime, pietanze di carne speciali. Il dessert cheesecake con gli anacardi favoloso."
4,Mandala Street 3rd floor so peaceful. Ordered a salad and the waitress was very attentive and offered cashews instead of walnuts. The food and fresh juice were great. However it took so long to catch her eye (it was not busy) after the plates were cleared that we opted for the bill rather than a cake dessert. Good for our waistlines at least. Lovely place to eat a light lunch.
5,"Tried our first dal bhat at Forest & Plate and it didn't disappoint. Food was great and the portions were plentiful. The team were also really lovely, attentive and helpful. Would also really recommend the cheese balls."
5,"I never really bother to write reviews, but wow, I can't not mention this one. A hidden gem in Thamel.. Tastiest salads I've probably ever tried, perfect mixture of ingridients, all veggies and fruit (veggies and fruits, in Nepal!!) are so fresh and full of flavor.. Pastas, meat, veg, seafood tasting platters, cocktails.. everything I've tried so far was tasteful and just delicious. All cooked in an open kitchen, ideal hygene, nice music and light, perfect, very kind and human service.. And very affordable prices. Thank you, guys, you are great! "
5,"Amazing spot, definitely worth a visit. Amazing food and friendly staff. The cats are cute too"
5,"Best restaurant I've visited in Kathmandu/Thamel district.
Fresh ingredients used in all dishes.
Well done!"
5,"Lovely Husband and Wife with their loyal/ talented staff has been growing Forest to Plate from a sprout to beautiful blossoming maturity.
Freshest Salads and so much more are available on the consistantly, delectable menu. Generous portions presented artisticly from the Forest to Plate.
Clean, open kitchen where you can see your delicious meal being created from the comfortable seating /eating area.
A  culinary experience that will delight your taste buds. Do yourself a favor and go.
Challenging to narrow down my favorite meal, although, if you were twisting my arm I would have to say "" GUACAMOLE  SALAD!!""
To day is the day to be good to yourself.
Enjoy."
5,"Great place for Western and Nepali food.  The pasta bolognese was tremendous,  as is everything else on the menu.  It's on the top floor...look for the stairs in a corner of this very nice enclosed area/walkway for shops and little restaurants.  The staff is very attentive and nice.  Overall, a very satisfactory restaurant experience, and we had great meals 3x out of our 8 days so far in Kathmandhu."
5,Place doesn't have much of sitting capacity so you may need to wait. Salads are amazing and you can enjoy fresh vegetables juices along with salads
5,"Ein nettes, kleines Restaurant im 3. Stock. Schone Salate, tolle Pasta! Freundliches Personal in gemutlichem Ambiente. Passt!"
5,"Abbiamo mangiato qui diverse volte. Qualita prezzo super. Lo consiglio.
Le polpette di formaggio sono una bomba."
5,"Absolutely love this place - delicious food, friendly owners and staff and great atmosphere (especially with the cute cats)!"
5,"The best restaurant in Kathmandu so far! Great environment, amazing food, very friendly staff and quick serving! :)"
5,"Namasteee/Lasso, this place, far away from our homes, felt like a little piece of home. In those five months in Nepal, we visited every time we were in Thamel and didn't even have to order because they remembered all our favourite dishes. It is such a lovely ambience, delicious food, great service and super personal. We loved this place and would 1000000...x recommend it if you are in Kathmandu. It is a hidden gem and well worth a try. We miss the great salads (no chicken add chickpeas;) ) So much love to you all from Camilla and Sophia"
5,"Forrest and Plate in Kathmandu is a must-visit! Fresh and tasty salads, just a delight for any food lover.The vibrant atmosphere and attentive service make each visit exceptional. Highly recommend this gem for anyone looking for delicious, healthy dining! "
5,"Premier fois a Kathmandou... Nous n'avons pas ete decus !!!

Les plats sont excellents ! Nous n'avons choisi que dans les specialites Nepalaises et sur le conseil de la maitresse de maison.

Les cheese balls, qui en elles-memes, peuvent paraitre tres simples et sans interet, sont a tomber et nous en avons repris. Le melange de fromage merite l'attention et la curiosite de le connaitre.

Jolie presentation des plats et un raffinement qui sont un regal.

L'accueil, le service et la gentillesse des gens de cet etablissement et des Nepalais, en general, sont inestimables.

Ne ratez pas cet endroit qui en plus d'etre bon, est beau. En terrasse et au calme c'est une parenthese enchantee qui nous est offerte.

De plus, il y a 2 chats qui ne dedaigneront pas les caresses que vous leur offrirez...

Peut-etre y retournerons nous avant notre depart. Et sinon ce sera de nouveau notre premier resto lors d'un futur voyage..."

5,Very delicious pizza.
5,"Tasty Food & Great Vibe in Thamel

We stopped by Jasper Restaurant while exploring Kathmandu, and it ended up being one of our favorite meals. The place has a chilled, welcoming vibe - perfect for taking a break from the busy streets of Thamel.

I had the momos, which were fresh and juicy - honestly some of the best I've had in Nepal so far. My wife went for the Thakali chicken set, which was packed with flavor and came with all the traditional sides. My daughter  tried the classic chicken with rice - simple, but done really well and super satisfying.

The staff were friendly and made us feel at home, and we liked the option to sit outside and enjoy the evening. We decided to sit inside.
Prices were reasonable too, especially for the quality of food and the location.

If you're in Kathmandu and want something local but clean and consistent, Jasper is a solid pick. We'll definitely be back before we leave."
5,"Lovely place in a nice garden. Delicious momos. Can definitely recommend!
They also open and still serve food when most other places are closed."
5,"El sitio es un refugio de paz en la ciudad. Nos han tratado muy bien. El servicio es increible. Nos atendio Prakash. Es muy atento. Y la comida tambien increible. Nos ha gustado mucho. Tambien muy limpio.
100% recomendable."

5,"Nice, love the garlic bread"
4,"Bonne petite adresse. Excellente pizza. Service un peu opressan, on se sent surveille en permanence. Presence d'un rat dans la cour pendant le repas. Pizzas un peu cher en comparaison aux autres restaurant et au cadre."

5,"Amazing place with great service, highly recommend. Shout out to Prakash Vai for an amazing service.
Thankyou to the entire team."
4,"Good place but little overrated in my opinion. The dishes kinda small and because there is a lot of people you barely have a place to sit and you need to wait long time until the food is coming.

Still 4 stars because the food was good and also the quality."
5,"We enjoyed the basil fried rice, steam momos and tofu tacos. Our waiter, Siva was very warm and attentive."
5,"Been here almost daily for a month, sometimes here the whole day, doing stuff on my laptop.

Lots of tourists come here.
You'll see new faces often.

Nice hookah lounge as well upstairs. They have a small assortment of wines as well.

Most polite and friendly staff."
5,We went there for corporate event. The manager and the team was super warm and accommodating of our needs. I would definitely recommend. The dumpling is amazing

4,Decent prices and big portions. Went there for breakfast. My food was a bit oily but it was tasty. Would like to visit again someday in the afternoon to taste their lunch/brunch menu.
1,I was disappointed with my visit due to the poor service. Our server was not only slow but also had a very rude and condescending attitude.
1,"Waiters were disrespectful, and also after complaining about the food they were being over smart"
1,Very disappointing food and service!!! Waiters are very disrespectful.
1,Very bad service. Staff not at all cooperative

5,"Loved it, came back several times with our teenage kids"
4,"Beautiful spot, decent prices and good food. But the service is a bit lame. Can be slow or a bit chaotic. Real shame and kind of weird cause there is like 1000 staff"
5,"Excellent atmosphere, great food but most importantly wonderful service.
I ate here for dinner yesterday evening, the food was great. I had a burger, chicken wings and a cocktail.
What impressed me the most was the service.
I had a young man named Shiva who was waiting on my table. He noticed that I wasn't eating the wings. I really didn't like the chicken wings (too much batter & not enough chicken).
I didn't complain but Shiva came to my table to ask me if there was any issue. He took my feedback, then went back to the kitchen to speak with the Chef and then returned with something much better.
Shiva really cared about my experience and made me feel valued as a customer. Definitely I will eat here again."
5,"Vraiment excellent ! Meilleur petit dejeuner a l'occidentale de Katmandou.
Je recommande les pancakes (fluffy cloud cakes), vraiment delicieux et aeriens.
Le iced mango matcha est excellent aussi.
La salle au premier etage est tres agreable.

Nous etions egalement venus pendre un verre le soir, leurs cocktails sont tres bon."
5,"We had an amazing time at 4 Stories, Thamel! The Sexy Chicken Dumplings were juicy and packed with flavor, while the Meat Lover Pizza was loaded and satisfying. The Iced Berry Latte was refreshing with a fruity twist, and the Matcha Blueberry Latte had a unique, creamy blend of matcha and sweetness. Great rooftop vibe, good service, and totally worth the visit "
5,"Se espera que la comida sea de 10, y lo supera con creces, esta todo riquisimo. Pero lo que no te esperas es un servicio como el suyo. Cada uno de los camareros y trabajadores son extremadamente hospitalarios, amables, y cuidadosos. Eso hace que toda la experiencia sea increible y super agradable, he vuelto varias veces y lo seguire haciendo. 100% recomendado."
4,Drinks were amazing but the food were ok-ish.
5,"Relaxed yet bustling, calm yet energising.. this preppy spot embraces the paradoxes beautifully.  An aesthete like me can feast on their minimal yet tastefully done-up decor, and still have an appetite for their large selection of food and beverages.  Special shout-out to their barista staff: I've had coffee in a lot of countries, but never seen such a beautiful lion in my latte cup before!  Definitely coming back here again on my next visit to KTM "
5,"Pretty good food in a trendy, relaxed environment! The service from Bikram is always great. He is very professional and knows how to make a customer feel valued."
5,"We loved this place and came back multiple times, the atmosphere, staff and food were all very great. We were served by Bikram and Nishan and they were both extremely friendly and provided great service! We would 100% recommend!"
4,Nice place to chill
5,Manish magar - Superb Place and for 2days superb hospitality from our brother right here. Kudos to the team for the nice food and hospitality. Need to try most of their food here. It is nicee foshoooo!!
4,Everything was superb....I wish they cud add some no onion garlic options too. They seemed to b quite rigid in making any alternatives for those with spl dietary requirements !
5,worth it
5,I love this place! Staff Nishan and Bikram are epic. Cool pillows to sit on!
5,Nishan goated frfr
5,Great place! Good food and good taste and good service !
5,Breakfast was super delicious with varieties 
3,Atmosphere is great and it's good for photos. But the food is only ok.
4,"This seating here is very beautiful. The first time I sat on the balcony with friends, the second time on the floor with cushions. I ordered 2 pizzas the first time, it was ok, I have had better pizza. We also got custom requested chocolate lassi, which we appreciated, but there was not much chocolate taste. My friend liked the matcha. The second time I got nachos and a smoothie bowl. The food was ok, you mostly come here for the atmosphere."
5,"Perfect vibes with great western food
If u r foreigner that highly recommended
Xiang Nian Xi Fang Shi Wu Jiu Ke Lai Zhe

5,"4 Stories has become a part of my daily routine during my stay in Kathmandu! The food is amazing but mostly keep coming back because the staff is so lovely. Big shoutout to Nishan and Bikram, their smiles and wonderful energy everyday makes my morning"
5,Nishan gurung was a wonderful server. I enjoyed my eggs on toast and banana smoothie very much. 4Stories is a peaceful start to the day.
5,Best food n matcha- Nishan was also really kind :))(
5,Great place to hangout and have your snacks.
4,they have a single washroom for both genders that too infront of entrance in first floor. i found it unhygienic and weird.
5,"Sehr entspannt, sehr lecker und der perfekte Ort um zu entspannen oder eine ruhige Zeit mit Freunden zu verbringen."
5,Bikram is really great! The full space has great food really good music and atmosphere really wonderful place to go to!
5,"We LOVED our experience in the cafe/restaurant! Super pretty and a lovely atmosphere (but indeed quite western - lots of tourists, which we didn't mind that much though). It was a great spot to chill, read, eat and just have a relaxing time in this big city. Also great food with loads od vegetarian options."
3,"Used to be really good but recently tried their smoothie bowl and it was such a big disappointment.
Waitress took too long to bring two smoothie bowls. And when she did, she brought one then took another 30 mins to get the other.
It's a busy place so you don't really get a table so be prepared for that.
A foreigner hub."
5,"And absolute gem of Kathmandu .
Lovely staff, makes you feel welcome, very genuine and friendly.
Sitting area (sofas) on the second floor are highlight of this place .
Good food (excellent selection)
Great place to spend a day reading, studying, chilling ...
Will be back!"
5,Very cool place. I try vegan pitza. Manish Neupane thank you :)
5,Super good breakfast and Very good service by Nishan thanks
5,"Best place in Kathmandu. Beautiful design, very friendly stuff. Especially Manju has conquered my heart by her very friendly and professional service. I love the very healthy Smoothie Bowls
 a place where I want to go again and again !! "
1,"Truth review!!!
I saw this place on TikTok as a top matcha in Kathmandu. I went there twice and ordered matcha, but both times, the flavor and presentation were terrible. Matcha is supposed to be green and have just pure milk taste. The service was equally poor. I informed the worker that I needed more matcha because it tasted like milk, and he said he would bring more, but he didn't. Meanwhile, the ice had already melted while I was waiting for the matcha. I didn't even drink it. I do not recommend this place."
5,"Nice place to sit and chill out...
Staff was very friendly and helpful."
5,"4Stories Cafe truly impressed me! The ambiance is cozy and creative -- perfect for catching up with friends or getting some work done. The food was delicious, and the drinks were refreshing and well-presented. The staff were friendly and made us feel right at home. Loved the rooftop vibe and the calm atmosphere. Definitely one of my new favorite hangout spots in the city!"
5,One of the best in Nepal
5,"Yes, it is full of foreigners and expats, but service, ambience, and drinks are spot on."
5,"Nice atmosphere, yummy breakfast and friendly/quick staff! Good WiFi too. Will come back :)"
5,"really loved this place. The quality of the food and coffee was amazing. So impressive and stood head and shoulders above the rest of the experiences I had in Nepal. Service is also great. Fast, efficient and super friendly. Highly recommend."
5,Discovered this wonderful spot while exploring Thamel. Truly enjoyed the atmosphere here. The food is also quite tasty. I recommend it for those looking to relax and enjoy good food.
5,"Visual aesthetics here is crazy good, really adds to the whole atmosphere. Would go back again even if it's just to give my eyes a treat!"
5,"Lieu cosy, endroit fancy"
3,Loved the ambience. 3 stars for service as our drinks took a lot of time to arrive even after asking multiple times.
5,"5atar for all aspect, food, service, atmosphere. bikram and nishant delivered great service and I enjoyed my time dining here."
5,Lovly dip love 
5,"Very aesthetic & instagrammable cafe!
In my opinion a must visit cafe in thamel"
5,"Great place with great service
Especially Bickram, one of the waiters!
He's half the reason to come here!"
5,"Stumbled across the place, and I was not disappointed. Opted for satay chicken and pulled pork tacos. Sweet baby jesus and the orphans; incredible.
The staff were superb,  including the security man on the gate made you feel most welcome.
Special shout ot to Matama. She couldn't do enough for me and super attentive; and her radiant smile could melt Antarctica. Will definitely be back."
5,Great place nice atmosphere great cocktails made by ayush bhat
2,"Ain't really worth the Instagram hype if you're going here for food. The atmosphere is nice and floors are separated for smoking and nonsmoking but we weren't told about it and only noticed on our way out so we ended up sitting on the smoking floor. Would be nice if the staff confirmed such things. Takes a lot of time for the food to come out.

Definitely recommend the 1F and 2F for cozy, quiet, calm environment. Good place to get your coffee and spend couple hours working on your laptop but nothing more than that."
5,I have been in Kathmandu for nearly a month and this is definitely my favourite place. It is mainly for tourists but there is also some local people. The food is great and safe to eat. The workers are so friendly. Great place to relax.
4,Food was so good and asthetic on point. I saw open kitchen where there's no age limit to work which is great initiative to collaborate with young gen and middle gen working  together.
1,"Disappointed is an understatement. The way I was treated at Supper Club was completely unacceptable. The bouncers were rude, aggressive, and lacked even the most basic understanding of hospitality. This is a service based industry where respect, professionalism, and calm conflict resolution should be a priority but instead, the staff chose hostility and arrogance. The management was no better, showing zero accountability or concern. If this is how they treat their guests, they have no business being in hospitality."
4,"This club is a whole vibe! I was initially quite sceptical about going to a disco because I'm sensitive to loud noise, but I'm so glad I gave it a try. The atmosphere, music, and overall energy made it a night to remember. It was absolutely worth it, and I'd highly recommend experiencing it at least once -- you might be pleasantly surprised, just like I was"
2,"We went to the club a few days back, I was there with my friends. We ordered 3 tequila shots at first which was fine We drank and went back to the floor and we ordered another round and they gave us thakali shots instead of tequila shots. Idk what they were thinking maybe they thought that we're already drunk and we wouldn't know but we could clearly smell local raksi for hours. They charged us 5400 and gave us local raksi instead of tequila. Making a fuss about it didn't feel right at that moment so we paid and got outta that place. We've decided not to drink at the bar inside anymore."
4,Free entry but expensive order
5,Night spot for a drink.or two
4,"The food here was alright, the service was great and the atmosphere was beautiful. Got the har gow and char siu noodles and they were pretty good. The har gow filling was very soft, almost too soft and mixed unlike traditional har gow with the whole shrimp filling. The char siu was good and well sauced."
1,"Was an amazing hangout place earlier but now it's trash they cheat the client with alcohol and increase the bill amount
I personally had experience the bar people making fool of us in the quantity of Liquior
Being a regular drinker we exactly know the quantity"
2,"It's good to be part of supper, everything was nice and clean, it was a Monday,maybe it's slow day for the club. I don't mind but it's Nepal. Most of the people came here from Nepal. One of my friend had boring with Thier boring live English music and even they didn't have good lyrics and pronunciation of words on Beats. Live music must be 80% Nepali and remain orthers music. I don't have any problem with that English songs. But should be entertain for customers. Good wished for upcoming future. Will be there next time. For sure."
5,A really enjoyable place for music and cocktails!
5,I spent one of my best night in kathmandu
1,"Worst staffs i ever had in my entire clubbing experience
Specially Bouncers
Rude talk
Garud security
Change the security
Club is good but the bouncer/security too much rude they dont know how to talk with their guest !!
What kind of management is that 0 rating on security if that is still there the guy with the tattoo on his shoulder we will give whole negative review to this club
Poor security!!"
5,Danced after ages. Visited twice during my vacation in Kathmandu. Definitely coming back again.
5,"A Hidden Gem in Thamel!

Rating: 5/5 stars

I stumbled upon the Supper Club in Thamel, Kathmandu, and I'm so glad I did! This place is a hidden gem, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Thamel's streets.

The ambiance is cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and comfortable seating. The staff are friendly and attentive, making sure you feel right at home.

But the real star of the show is the food! The portion sizes are generous, and the prices are very reasonable.

Overall, I highly recommend the Supper Club to anyone looking for a great dining experience in Thamel. It's a must-visit!"
4,Aru club banda ramro lagyo. Bahira patti open space ma hawa khana paine. Bhitra pani good space. Entry fees pani nalagne recha.
5,"Thamel has plenty of options, but this spot truly stands out as a celebration of flavor, creativity, and hospitality. The standout for me was meticulously crafted food and cocktails menu with attentive service. The ambiance is vibrant yet warm and cozy which sets tone for exceptional meal. Would be visiting again "
5,We ordered Dan Dan noodles. A MUST TRY if you can handle spicy food. Veg momo is better than Chicken momo although they are quite good too. Chicken momo lovers try the veg first. I'm too impressed.
3,"Food: 3 | Service: 4 | Atmosphere: 4

We ordered Xiaolongbao but it was really disappointing and overpriced for what was served. Just a plate of tiny dry pork mo:mo, no soup at all.

Other food were decent, the atmosphere is good and the staff are friendly."
5,"Awesome time, great vibes food and staff. Definitely worth checking out for a night."
4,Enjoyed karoake over here
3,Ok but bit pricey
1,"Racist club  - allowed other languages for karaoke but only refused Hindi
Would not recommend visiting"
5,The food and cocktails are excellent and everyone enjoyed themselves. Perfect place for dimsum and disco. Exceptional service from the entire staff !! And all of them were very friendly and cooperative.
5,"Delicious dimsum, sushi and new one dampa.
Thank you"
5,"I love this club because there is so many delicious of food like dimsum,sushiand Many cocktail and Mocktail."
5,"Nice food and beverage.
specially dimsum too good."
5,"I enjoyed a lot of this club.
Thank you so much"
5,Supper club is one of the best club which is located in heart of thamel .if you guys are disco party lover genuinely i wanna suggest all of you that visit that place atleast one time .
5,Nice club
1,Totally unsatisfied with your services
1,Horrible place!
1,Someone tried to grope my friend here. And the bouncer did nothing.
2,"We were at the restaurant this Wednesday for my niece's farewell, everything is great, drinks were awesome specially cocktails and mocktails next level but sad to say that me nd my family have a worst food experience, everything we order was so bad all we can taste was very salty, uncooked spices and the time we have to wait for our food was different story, we all were very excited for food but it was a worst dine in experience till date. Seriously food department needs a good ramp up."
5,Great club
5,"I had a fantastic experience at the Supper Club when I visited with my wife and family for late-night food and clubbing. The moment you step into the top floor of the Sher Bhawan building, you're transported to another world. The high ceilings and 80s disco theme create a unique atmosphere that sets it apart from other restaurants in Kathmandu.

The pan-Asian menu of the restaurant has a great range of selection. I particularly enjoyed the dan dan noodles, xiao long bao, and the golden garlic fried rice. As the night progressed, more people arrived for the club scene. By midnight, the place was buzzing with energy as old school disco songs filled the air. We found ourselves lost in the nostalgia, dancing and enjoying drinks well into the early hours.

One of the great things about this place is that it's open until 5 am, allowing for a full night of fun. If you need a break from dancing, you can always pop into the restaurant area for some delicious skewers.

I noticed there seemed to be more women here compared to other clubs in Thamel, which I think is due to the visible security presence throughout the venue. This created a comfortable atmosphere for everyone, and my wife and family felt at ease all night.

One other awesome thing about Supper Club is they also own a hotel - GaasBaas Co, located in the 2nd and 3rd floor of the building of this restaurant. We actually booked a room at this hotel which allowed us to enjoy our time at Supper Club to the fullest.

For anyone looking for a combination of great food and a vibrant club scene in Thamel, I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try. It's a unique spot that offers both excellent dining and a fun night out.                "
1,"Bad food, tasteless never and ever try this place. It was one of the worse food i had in my life !!!"
5,Didn't try the food but the atmosphere was good with live music. Nice sound system with good vibes.
5,Perfect place for clubbing
3,Food used to be better than this!
5,Goood Place
5,Good food and shisha
1,Worst experience ever from the management.
5,"This club is a paradise for cocktail lovers. The menu offers unique and uncommon cocktails that are definitely worth trying! The ambience is perfect for music enthusiasts who want to dance their hearts out. With live music and talented DJs, the atmosphere is electric. In my experience, this place stands out from other clubs and bars due to its upclass vibe. The crowd here is disciplined and cool, and there is plenty of space for dancing. The beautiful lighting adds to the overall charm. Overall, a fantastic club with a great atmosphere."
5,"I've eaten here 4 times during my hotel stay. The dhampa menu is an excellent deal. You can't beat the tasty bucket of food with unlimited sides and cocktails. My party tried both the seafood and chicken bucket and if you don't want a dhampa bucket, their dumplings and dim sum are delicious! Our waiter Bhuwan and Jonga the manager made sure our service was excellent and glasses never empty"
5,"How can i explained  because the supper club in side of  gaas baas Co. that was Actually  amazing and Fantastic...  the place the Environment the feelings actually you feel when you go in side of the gaas baas co. and Supper club that was actually to good and make your mind cool and fresh.. when you are  frustated and bored.
This words are not enough for the explanation about that experience... the experience i  got it from the supper in side of the gaas baas co... i Personally recommend to you all guys  most go supper on gaas baas co. Because  on there you guys can Easily got live band , live DJ and also karaoke on there with 0  entry fee  because on others place you guys have to pay for that live band DJ and. Karaoke but there is no more cost for that and that's why I'm personally recommended about that place on there you guys can get new experience about pan asian food with DIM SUM CHINESE and. Japanese sushi's and just like i already told you abouts live band , dj and. Karaoke all of things on there with high level Security with garud  and room is also Available on there with high level security when you guys are tried with enjoying your self on supper.  and also try dampa food on there because that dampa is Philippians main course food and that food available on with only under 1150 ... there is a 3 types of dampa so don't be late to enjoy your self inside of the supper club with new food experience ( pan asian  and dampa )  and live band , dj with good security.... i love supper and all the staff who worked on there they are so kind and sweet ..."
5,"I can't express how great the service was here.

From the moment you step in, the ambiance is just perfect - super welcoming and cozy, making it an ideal spot whether you're out with friends, family, or even on a date.
Now, let's talk about the food. Every single dish we tried was bursting with flavor, showcasing the rich and authentic tastes of Nepalese cuisine. But if you're going, you absolutely have to try their grilled specialties. Seriously, they're masterpieces! Each bite was perfectly cooked, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. You can tell they put a lot of care into every dish.
Beyond the amazing food and atmosphere, the service was top-notch. The staff were so friendly, attentive, and really made us feel right at home. They were happy to answer our questions and offer recommendations, which really added to the whole experience.
Kathmandu Grill Restaurant isn't just a meal; it's a delightful culinary journey. Whether you're a long-time fan of Nepalese food or looking to try something new and exciting, this place is a must-visit. You'll definitely leave with a happy stomach and a big smile! Five stars all the way!"

1,"The worst dining experience during our entire 2-week trip in Nepal.

This was the last restaurant we visited before heading home, and unfortunately, it left the worst impression.

The staff member taking our order stood over us the entire time, making the process feel rushed and uncomfortable. Then it took forever just to input the order.

There was a group of local customers seated next to us who waited around 10 minutes, and no one even came to take their order -- they eventually gave up and left. That alone says a lot about the service.

Out of the four dishes we ordered, only two were okay -- nothing special. One was mediocre, and the grilled duck was downright terrible. It was extremely dry, oddly textured, and took a thousand bites to chew. Here's a photo for reference:

When we finished eating, we raised our hands and waited patiently for over five minutes, but the lazy staff intentionally ignored us. I eventually had to shout out just to get someone to bring the bill.

This was especially disappointing because we had fantastic experiences with other high-end restaurants in Nepal -- great food, attentive service, and warm hospitality. This place was the complete opposite.

Don't be fooled by the fake-looking positive reviews. Our experience was terrible, and we absolutely do not recommend this restaurant."

Ojo, tienen todo para mejorar pero deben cambiar la calidad de los ingredientes y capacitarse mas en la elaboracion de una autentica pizza. No es la peor que he comido, pero esperaba otra cosa. Espero que puedan mejorar, les deseo exito. Mi nota es por la pizza. La atencion es cordial y el ambiente normal."

5,"I arrived back in Kathmandu yesterday, I am lucky enough to visit every 18mts or so. This place never disappoints, time after time over the last 7 or 8 years I have eaten here and would now say it's my favourite spot. Dinner last night was just delicious . There is consistent high standards at  this restaurant both in food quality and service.
I don't often do reviews but this place deserves it."
5,"Beautiful respite right off the busy thamel market. Once u enter, u feel like you're in a different world. The food was decent, and the service showed the right amount of care and professionalism. Very reasonably priced and the ambiance is quite appeasing. Highly recommend"
5,"A little bit of peace and tranquility in Kathmandu.  Really loved the goat cheese appetizer-- the caramelized onion jam was delicious.  Salads are always fresh, and the mushroom soup was very creamy.   Honestly you can't go wrong here"
5,"Wandering through the lively maze of Thamel, I came across this cool little courtyard with open-air tucked in the heart of a building, lush with greenery. The calm atmosphere and fresh air offered a quiet contrast to the city's buzz.

Friendly staffs welcomed me warmly, the service was excellent. I enjoyed a plate of ravioli with fungi and a local beer for dinner, simple yet delicious."
5,"Amazing place to have a good meal after a tiring trek !!! I had chicken momo and House Rosemary chicken, amazing ! Outdoor court with plants is very pleasany, staff is very professional and nice ! 100% recommend this restaurant"
5,Love eating at Rosemary Kitchen. The food is wonderful and the staff are really lovely. Highly recommend Rosemary Kitchen.
2,"Waiters were nice and helpful, place looks nice, but...
Food was the worst I've had in 2 weeks in Nepal. Ordered beef - maybe just they don't know how to make it, but it was very, very poor. Had beef in other restaurant before in Nepal and it was good, so I was surprised with very low meal quality despite good spices.

Cake was OK (but had much better in other places), yak cheese was good.

Overall, despite helpful service, I see no reason to go there - there is so many much better places."
5,Really enjoyed my mushroom choila and yoghurt cheesecake (949 Rs = $11 AUD) lovely service and enjoyed the comfy seating area :)
5,Absoluter Geheimtipp. Ich habe noch nie so fabelhaft in Nepal zu Fruhstuck gegessen. Das Personal ist super freundlich und aufmerksam. Die Pancakes waren so fluffig und der Cafe schmeckt hervorragend. Leider gab es kein Avoccado-Toast an diesem Tag. Das tut der Bewertung aber kein Abbruch. Einfach hingehen und im Garten entspannen.
4,"Une bonne adresse proche de Thamel, le coeur de Katmandou, une excellente cuisine est proposee. L'accueil est sympa. Un petit reproche : un manque de lumiere."
5,"Wonderful place, I come every day during staying in Kathmandu. Avocado salad and Rosemary chicken are highly recommended. Lot's of options for the fresh juice, I preferred the carrot one. Definitely will come again."

5,"Easy to find, in a city of meandering streets and lanes.
Service was very hard to fault, as was the food.
Highly recommended."
5,"Beautiful open air restaurant serving traditional Nepali food, European, vegan and vegetarian dishes.
The food is so delicious, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is peaceful amidst the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu."
5,"Back in Kathmandu and revisited Rosemary. This time we had a full meal which was excellent. (Trout for my wife, pork chop for me.). I had a draught Sherpa IPA beer which was excellent, easily as good quality as many craft beers in the UK."
4,"February 2024:

The food & ambience are great. Plus, they have wifi and a nice bathroom... However, they add a 13% VAT charge, which really inflates the bill amount. No other place I've eaten at in Kathmandu or Dhulikhel has added a VAT amount, so it's a bit annoying for me to pay 13% extra at this eatery.
4 Stars "
5,"Rosemary Kitchen: A Hidden Gem in Kathmandu
During a recent trip to Kathmandu, I stumbled upon Rosemary Kitchen while shopping for trekking providers in the Jhyata Area. This unplanned discovery quickly became my favorite spot in the city, surpassing all expectations.

Food Quality -
The food at Rosemary Kitchen is exceptional. Their momo was the best I've ever had--flavorful, perfectly steamed, and served with a tangy sauce. The dal bhat and Nepali thali were comforting and rich in flavor, showcasing the use of fresh, local ingredients. The menu also offers international dishes, with highlights like a fresh vegetarian pasta and indulgent desserts like chocolate cake and mango sorbet.

Menu Options -
The diverse menu caters to all tastes, with options for vegetarians, vegans, and meat lovers alike. From classic Nepali comfort food to light, healthy choices and global dishes, there's something for everyone.

Ambiance -
Rosemary Kitchen boasts a cozy, welcoming atmosphere with a mix of rustic and modern decor. Whether you choose to dine indoors or on the outdoor terrace, the peaceful vibe makes it the perfect place to relax after a busy day of sightseeing or trekking.

Convenience and Location -
Conveniently located in Jhyata Area, close to trekking providers and shopping spots, it's an ideal stop for travelers. The friendly staff ensures a seamless experience, and the fast service makes it a great choice for a quick, satisfying meal.

Prices -
Despite the high-quality food and service, Rosemary Kitchen offers great value with reasonably priced dishes. Whether you're on a budget or looking to treat yourself, the pricing is affordable.

Final Thoughts -
I'm so glad I found Rosemary Kitchen by chance. It's a must-visit in Kathmandu for its delicious food, inviting atmosphere, and reasonable prices. I'll definitely be returning next time I'm in the city!"
5,"Definitely one of the best restaurant in Kathmandu! The food was so good that we went there many times! They have a large choice of food, Indians, Nepali but also continental. It's a great value for money as the dishes are very affordable. The waiters were also very kind and smiley. Highly recommended!"

5,Nice coffee there
5,"bellissimo locale, curato e pulito. ampia e ottima scelta nei piatti. un momento di eleganza nel cuore di Katahmandu. in inverno importante chiedere il tavolo all'interno anche se il giardino e meraviglioso."
3,"Okay the food is pretty average to be honest.
You will like the sitting space and probably enjoy the atmosphere of the place. The food is not 'bad' but not that good either."
5,"Si no el mejor, uno de los mejores sitios para comer en Katmandu. La comida impresionantemente buena, la carta muy amplia, el local precioso y super limpio, los camareros muy amables y atentos... para repetir."
5,"Wir hatten ein sehr leckeres Weihnachtsmenu, toller Service."
5,Wonderful place. In and out possible. Excellent coffees and amazing Teriyaki Tofu Noodles  Thank you 
3,"Nice enough interior with an inner courtyard, but very expensive food. Alcohol prices are reasonable, though the WiFi around the lobby seating is weak, and they didn't have any large straws for the smoothie so I had to use a spoon to finish my drink. 3/5 is fair."
4,"The avocado salad for 700 is very delicious. You can add smoked salmon to it for another 400, but it is just a very small peace - not worth it. The salad came without dressing and only a very small piece of bread, i had to order more bread then twice. The service is ok, but could be faster and more attentive."
5,Had a amazing experience with good food drinks and nepal premiere league game good time spent here its like sports bar also
5,"Very good Veg Thali, a pretty restaurant."
4,"Everybody's really into this place, but it's honestly not a big deal. The food is not good either."
5,Enjoyed a dinner here. Lovely place
3,Waited over an hour for food and the currys were very bland. Lots of food blogs online rate this place but was very average
5,"Found this place completely by accident. From the outside, it looks like a coffee shop. When you step inside, you find it's an open air cafe/restraint with a very relaxed vibe. I had dinner here and it was great. The staff were friendly and helpful. The menu was simple yet full of interesting dishes. Well worth a visit!"
3,Ristorante occidentale. Ho mangiato piatto con pollo alla piastra e patate. Prezzo in euro circa 8

5,"A lovely place with an outside courtyard, varied menu, good beer, and excellent service. If you crave pizza, this place rivals Fire and Ice for quality. Full of western tourists but maybe that's what you want!"
5,"one of very few places in Thamel that opens at 7am. inside atmosphere is really great - like a big garden with trees..
great choices for breakfast - all types and kinds for every taste... brownie with ice cream is to kill for (i might've had 2 one day).. coffee is quite good as well (at least latte was). had breakfast here 3 days in a row, didn't get bored. ladies at the counter was super pleasant and friendly as well, setting good mood for the day!!! thanks a lot for the hospitality (and THE brownie.... omg, i'll miss it)"

3,"mqvm n`ym, hvkl hyh mmsh l tvb!!"
5,"The Old House is one of those classic places that you can't go wrong with. It's even better than the former, and a hideout that's full of class without people trying to flex.

Cocktails are super smooth, on point and a lot of subtle details have went into the ingredients and decor.

If you want a place to unwind with your friends or family, it's a spot that'll cater to your catchups as well as privacy too.

You don't feel like you're in a fishbowl, no long service times and well priced menu. A proper gem of a bar/restaurant."
5,Decent Cocktails
5,Nice place . Good for beers  and Other drinks.
5,"Excellent place and the best cocktails we had in Kathmandu, bartenders Anant and Jason took real good care of us and served us some really nice drinks. Highly recommended."
5,"Excellent

3,"The ambience of the place is very good. Waiters can be trained a bit better maybe. Their knowledge of the menu was limited.

Chicken skewers and the salmon steak were very delicious along with the mashed potatoes that were served.

The carbonara was extremely disappointing. The sauce seemed watery and broken and it was not salted properly."

1,"Be careful, they steal. Had new years eve dinner with friends here. For the sub par accommodation and basic service, its unnecessarily expensive. When i came the other day to get somethings left back in the location the housekeeping stole it and they made me wait for hours and still didn't get it back."

If you're planning to visit on a Friday, make sure to book a table in advance, otherwise you might have to wait. It's a perfect spot to spend quality time with your family or loved ones.

However, one thing that bothered me a little was that the smoking and non-smoking areas are not separated. Since many people smoke here, it can be uncomfortable for non-smokers."

5,Food was delicious what i thought price also reasonable .. antique interior
5,we had there momo and whole chicken  dish that was seupereb atmosphare was lil bit of ntiqu highly recomended for local food
1,"We ordered a chicken thali set and chicken tikka masala, there was a really bad smell coming from both dishes, the chicken tikka masala felt really old and had a really bad odor, one bite and I was immediately able to tell it was kept in the fridge for days and was just heated up for me. The chicken thali sets side dishes also felt cold and smelly that was clearly kept out for too long. Really disappointed with the food as we only literally took 2 bites before we asked the 2 boys in the restaurant to give us our bill and left the place. Would not recommend anyone to go there, there's also bunch of people inside the restaurant playing card, gambling, extremely loud atmosphere. In hindsight when we saw how the environment was that probably should have been our sign to not eat here."

The food was a bit on the salty side and came out a bit late, but all in all we had a wonderful meal.  The service was great.  The young man serving us was just wonderful.  We had rolls, momos with drinks, and thereafter had fried rice, chow mein and thantuk.  The price was reasonable for Thamel standards (tourist area).  I wholeheartedly recommend this place."

5,"A Delicious Ride to Mustang Flavours

Had an amazing food experience at Mustang Thakali by State III! The Mustang Thakali Thali was packed with authentic Himalayan flavors -- wholesome, hearty, and beautifully balanced. The Kanchampa was soft and nutty, and the Mustang Aloo had that perfect kick of spice and smokiness.

The surprise star? Their fresh watermelon juice -- chilled, naturally sweet, and super refreshing. A perfect match for the meal!

If you're craving a true taste of the hills in the city, this place delivers it with warmth and simplicity.

3,"!!!!!!!!
The only good part was the Staff Hospitality   service was good.. Staff response was better  But.. They need to improve alot in taste of their food 
Local chicken was not like local chicken  Trout fish tastes not well   even when we order meat jhol, jhol came like water  Happy when curd and lalmohan was with thali but they also tastes weird  Ambience was average  not as it shown in tiktok  If taste is improved this place has great potential "
5,Loved their food

2,"Thakali was average. Good part: they serve gulaab jaamun with curd. Worst part: everything else. Didnt like that boiler chicken curry or the small aalu fries. Also ordered a club sandwich, the sandwich was good though. They serve single shot coffee in iced lattee, I generally prefer two shots in my iced latte. The wait time was quite long as well."
5,So nice

5,This place serves an absolutely delicious thakali. Their mutton thakali is a gem. The service is quick and the atmosphere is great.
1,"What a disaster! Ordered few items as a regular guest and knowing their food is above par. However they rejected to provide momo achar and hot sauce. I could have easily paid extra for the sauce or even whole momo price to get achar. Total unprofessional staffs and even manager is horrible.  Didn't touch any of item ordered, paid the bill and left. Let's see next time."

5,"Magnific lloc per provar el plat nacional nepali, el thakali. Ara be, si he de destacar quelcom, seria els momo jhol... Bonissim!"
4,"Mustang Thakali by State III is a fantastic dining destination, offering a perfect blend of traditional flavors and modern amenities. The ambience is remarkable, with a choice of cozy indoor seating and an inviting open space setting, making it an ideal spot for any occasion.

The highlight of the menu is undoubtedly the Thakali rice set, which is a must-try. They offer this set in various options, including veg, mutton, chicken, and fish, catering to different preferences. The set itself is a delightful assortment of items, featuring rice, Himalayan bean daal, salad, yoghurt, lalmohan, papad, spinach, horseradish pickle, tomato pickle, potato fries, bitter gourd, dried spinach, and mushroom. The combination of flavors and textures is authentic and satisfying.

In addition to the Thakali set, the restaurant offers a variety of coffee options and alcoholic beverages, adding versatility to the dining experience. Payments are convenient, as they accept QR, Fonepay, cards, and cash. They even have a loyalty program for discounts, which is a nice touch. The only downside is that the prices could be slightly more affordable.

The restaurant also boasts ample parking, which is a big plus. Overall, Mustang Thakali is a great place for delicious food and a pleasant atmosphere."
5,Best thakali in Kathmandu
4,Good place to have Thakali.
4,"As for dhide Thakali, we prefer Jimbu in Kathmandu, but the buckwheat pancake super!"
1,"THE WORST thakali restaurant in town
From the service to the food
Recieved cold thaali with the soggiest papad I have ever witnessed and when asked for replacement we heard ""hamro yaha estai huncha"" which in literal means this is how we serve you food here"
5,"Mustang Thakali by State III offers an authentic and delightful experience of traditional Thakali cuisine. The restaurant stands out for its warm ambiance, attentive service, and flavorful dishes that capture the essence of Nepali food. The Thakali set, with its perfectly cooked lentils, tender meats, and spicy pickles, is a must-try. Whether you're looking for a hearty meal or just a taste of local culture, this spot is sure to leave a lasting impression. Highly recommended for anyone craving a genuine Nepali dining experience!"
5,"Great location, excellent Nepali thali and service!
I highly recommend Mustang Thakali By State III whether you're visiting Kathmandu or a local.  I would return back for sure!"

5,"I had one of my most memorable evenings at this restaurant. The menu beautifully blends Lebanese and Nepali flavors, offering a unique dining experience. The traditional Dal Bhat was absolutely delicious, and I truly hope to return one day."
5,"Ausgezeichnete Falafel, wahrscheinlich die besten die ich jemals gegessen hab! Auch sehr guter Hummus, Tabouleh...Service sehr flink und freundlich. Wurde definitiv wieder kommen."
5,Un bon restaurant un peu cher mais a l'ambiance tres calme et sympathique
5,"By far the best falafel in Kathmandu. I'd say one of the best falafels outside of the Middle East. Perfectly done: airy, perfectly fried, excellently seasoned.
Fatoush salad wonderfully seasoned. Delicious mint lemonade.
Awesome - thank you."
5,I love this restaurant it is by far one of my favourites in thamel. So cozy and service is excellent. Food is always exceptional.

4,"Good food, great seating and ambience. Vegetarian"
2,"Unfortunately quite disappointed in this place. The Fatoush salad had zero parsley in it. The sabich sandwich had one tiny piece of eggplant in it, but was otherwise filled with lettuce. I felt pretty ripped off."
1,"I was really disappointed with this restaurant, especially considering how popular it seems to be among tourists. The food was quite underwhelming--nothing special at all--and definitely didn't live up to the hype.

What made the experience worse was the service. The staff came across as very arrogant and unwelcoming. I honestly felt like I was bothering them just by being there, which made the whole visit quite uncomfortable.

I truly don't understand why this place is so well-known, when so many other restaurants in the area offer much better food and warm, friendly service. I wouldn't go back."
5,Amazing experience.
5,"I absolutely LOVE this place,  they make the best and freshest salads I ate in a long time,  as if it comes straight from the farm.  Don't miss this restaurant,  there are many other great dishes but those salads are just the best in Nepal and India  and sweet staff "

4,The vibe of the place is totally chilled and has a different type of set up. The cosy sitting on the floor and easy breezy set up is very inviting. The food is delicious. The menu is largely vegetarian with eggs as the only odd one out. Try their hummus and roti or the vegetable sizzler. The salads and Buddha bowls are very good too.

5,"We visited OR2K a couple of times because we liked the food and the relaxed atmosphere. The clientele is mainly in their 20s but we didn't at all feel unwelcome even though we are in our 60s. They have a good range of food including Mediterranean/Middle Eastern, paninis, pasta etc. Homemade lemonade highly recommended."
5,"Delicious food, superb service and lovely vibe.  One of our favorite places in Kathmandu and a must for our every visit.

Pretty much everything on the menu is good, but we absolutely love their vegetarian biryani.

Its a little hideout amongst some shops so its entrance a bit easy to miss, but its worth the search for sure!"
5,Love love love the food here. So good and great portions for the price! Falafel platter and potatoes were a godsend after our 12 day trek. Came here three times in our 5 days in Kathmandu it was so good!

3,I don't know why the reviews are so high the place for not it. The food mediocre
4,"Really relaxing and interesting atmosphere, a nice place where many memories can and have been made.

Unfortunately have to pass on the pizzas, the tomato sauce needs an update."
5,"Super moment passe dans ce restaurant. Le rapport qualite prix est excellent. L'ambiance est tamisee et l'on mange a la lueur des bougies. Bien sur comme le precise les autres commentaires on y mange en chaussettes et sur des coussins. C'est tres agreable ! Et pas d'odeurs de pieds a signaler bien que nous etions peu.

Nous avons pris deux cocktails a boire qui etaient excellents, le Mr Bean et un au citron.
Le repas etait vegetarien bien que nous ne le soyons pas. J'ai pris le burger de falafel qui etait excellent. Ma compagne a pris la salade de guacamole qui etait tres genereuse !
J'ai pris en dessert la crepe banane chocolat qui etait excellente aussi.

Seul petit defaut la lenteur du service apres le plat pour prendre un dessert.
Ceci dit l'endroit etant tres agreable et cela n'a pas ete un gros probleme.

Un de nos meilleurs restaurants de notre sejour !

Je recommande !"

4,"The food and ambience were overall very enjoyable. We ordered the pulled pork and the jaw dropper burger. The only downside was that the pulled pork burger was a bit difficult to eat since the meat was very tender, causing the burger to fall apart easily. Overall, I'd rate it 7.5/10."
5,"Best Burgers, It was a recommendation from a friend. "
5,Excellent
4,"This was my first time in Ts your palate. I liked the food I ordered but it was slightly salty for my taste personally since, I don't have habit of much salty food. Nevertheless, I loved the ambience and service. It is clean and quiet."

Smash the beast burger 5/10
OMG burger 5/10
Too hyped on the internet...
Drinks were 7/10 the thick Oreo shake and strawberry milkshake.
Parking has to be done nearby."
1,"Summary: Overpriced, hyped , poor quality , poor taste, lack of customer service.

Tried the mushu-Rama burger. (Rating:1/5)
As a vegetarian  this is my review:

-Overpriced : Rs.625 for mushroom burger.
More expensive than pork ones ?!

-flavor profile all over the place : the pungent bbq sauce and the other spices fighting for dominance, unbalanced salty.

-Texture: Lacking a good textured bun and the mushrooms were lacking the firmness.

-side dish: the nachos were the worst , no crunch bland nachos , and terrible salsa.

-customer service: we had to go and call the waiter to pick our order , we waited for about 20 mins.

The only thing decent enough is the seating.

I would never come to choose this when there are far better options near by ( examples : Zenbites, 4 stories , Godzilla sandwich) which are better priced for their quality and taste, and customer experience"
5,"Food was great! Came out quickly, one of the best burgers in Nepal!"
5,Aayush Shrestha was our server and recommended some excellent choices.
5,"Hands down, one of the best burgers I've ever had! Juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection -- every bite was pure satisfaction. The buns were soft, the toppings were fresh, and the fries? Crispy magic.
The vibe of the place is chill, the staff is friendly, and the service was quick.
If you're a burger lover, this place is a must-visit. 10/10 would burger again! "

My favorite? Hands down the Char-Grilled Salivator -- juicy, smoky, and packed with flavor.

4,Great food!!!
5,Great food. A+
4,"Tried the pulled pork burger, the bun seemed a little bit too dry and flaky, but the pork inside was good. We also had the pulled pork nachos, could have used a little more chips. Hope to try their Buffalo burgers someday. They do accept credit cards."
5,"Nos gusta mucho este restaurante de hamburguesas. Siempre que podemos, ordenamos en Patao y ahora hemos venido al lugar y la experiencia fue bastante buena.
Las hamburguesas estaban jugosas, con ingredientes frescos y bien combinados. Las papas fritas crujientes, con pollo, estaban bien sazonadas, fueron un buen acompanamiento.

El ambiente es agradable, con buena musica y un servicio amable. Los precios son razonables para la calidad que ofrecen.

!Recomendado si buscas una hamburguesa sabrosa en un lugar agradable, en Thamel!"
4,Good food

5,Tasty burgers
5,Loved every bite! The flavors were spot on and the ambiance made the whole experience even better. Friendly service and a cozy setting--definitely coming back for more!
5,"From the warm welcome to the last bite, everything about our dinner was perfect. The dishes were absolute magic !! I'm still thinking about that incredible flavour. What really stood out was how the staff made us feel, attentive without being intrusive, and genuinely passionate about the food they were serving.
The space itself strikes that rare balance between elegant and comfortable.
It's rare to find a place that gets every detail right, but ""Ts your palate"" nails it. We left already planning our next visit - and I'd tell anyone looking for a special night out to do the same.

 (Worth every penny)"
5,"Had a bad day at Clg and wanted something to freshen up the mind and the whole body, searched food place near me and got this place
The place truly lived up to the online ratings food the ambience all on point."

5,"Absolutely amazing experience at T's Palace! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth and hospitality. The atmosphere is inviting, the service is top-notch, and the attention to detail is impressive.

2,Food is not great. The ambience is good and the staffs are friendly
5,Just had the authentic Indian foods.
1,"Went there with a friend just to chill over a coffee and snack, but the whole experience was seriously off-putting. One of the waiters kept peeping at our table the entire time -- not in a professional way, but in a very creepy, invasive way. He kept staring at my friend and making her visibly uncomfortable. His looks and behavior came off straight-up perverted.

Even though we had already ordered, he kept coming back again and again, asking if we wanted anything else. It felt like we weren't even allowed to sit peacefully without being harassed into ordering more.

If you're a foreigner or a couple, I honestly suggest not going there. You'll likely be stared at, interrupted constantly, and made to feel unwelcome. Totally ruined the vibe. Never going back."
5,"""I had an amazing experience at this lounge and restaurant! The ambiance was cozy and inviting, with soft lighting and comfortable seating. The staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu, making excellent recommendations.
The food was incredible, with a diverse menu that catered to all tastes. I loved the creative on dishes, and the presentation was almost too beautiful to eat.
""The service was top-notch, with our server providing exceptional attention to detail. They were prompt, courteous, and went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed.
""I highly recommend this lounge and restaurant for a great dining experience. Whether you're looking for a romantic evening or a night out with friends, this place is sure to impress."
5,"Les serveurs sont totalement fou, j'ai jamais vu ca de ma vie
+ J'ai pu mettre de la frenchcore et de la uptempo sur les enceintes"
5,"We just had dinner at Carpe Diem Lounge & Bakery and the experience was absolutely outstanding. From the very beginning, the service was impeccable warm, attentive, and genuinely thoughtful. The staff made us feel completely welcomed and cared for.
What truly surprised us was the portion sizes: very generous, beautifully presented, and incredibly tasty. Every dish we ordered exceeded our expectations in both flavor and quantity. It's rare to find a place that delivers such a perfect mix of quality, value, and top-tier service.
Without a doubt, this is a must-visit spot if you're in Kathmandu and looking for an excellent dining experience in a cozy atmosphere with exceptional hospitality. We will definitely be coming back!"
1,"The food and atmosphere is amazing but one of the staff was creepy, he was staring at us all the time and we couldnt eat properly as we were so uncomfortable so the behaviour of the staff was creepy so the restaurant will be much better if the behaviour of the staff wasn't like this"
5,wow amazing 
1,We ordered 3 items out of which 1 was Chicken MOMO and it was served almost raw(red). Total negligence from the kotchen staff. Only the main waiter was helpful on the 1st floor.
5,Beautiful place
1,Excellent
4,Amazing place. Vibe is great. Nice food and service.
4,"Nice place and really surprised how i never got to know about it before.

Food was nice. Will not say it was the best but it wasn't bad at all.

Won't say service was bad either but they forgot some of the orders so giving it a 3. Plus got a slight feeling that they were serving foreigners better than they were serving us. Will definitely go back and hope this is not true though."
5,"Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious food"
4,Leuke tent met aardig personeel
3,"Carpe Diem Lounge & Bakery is a delightful spot that offers a cozy ambiance and a diverse  menu. Friendly and attentive staff, as well as the reasonable prices. Live music performances in the evenings add to the vibrant atmosphere."

5,"Delicious sandwich and momos, very generous servings for the price, nice setting"
4,"The food was tasty and well-balanced. The staff were friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place for its good food, nice atmosphere, and great service!"
5,"Can't tell enough, what a chic place amid the chaos of thamel, excellent food quality, extra special momos and the Mediterranean  breakfast, and the thakali too, I tried all veg. Rooftop hammock is the show stopper, simply awesome. Oh, also, the home baked multigrain breads, simple toast, and tea here can make your day. There is an extra lively staff, some cute and smiling all the time, and will post a pic below. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is passing by ktm for a comfortable food plus stay. The creativity, artwork, green, and plants will steal your heart. I wish there was a dedicated co-working space, and that's all. The food is open till 10.30pm a big plus."
5,Very nice Ambience with pleasant Surroundings.
5,"A lovely well run and quiet place for work enjoying the wonderful skyline and hills around Kathmandu. The service was very prompt by a female waiter, and the quality of food was very very good. I enjoyed a mutton biryani one night followed by a very tasty granola and pancakes."
5,Yummy 
5,Great !

5,Super endroit avec de bons plats
2,"Food is honestly really good, service unfortunately not. First evening I waited one hour for my order, two days later I gave it another try. I waited 30minutes for a menu before I left (I asked for a menu after 15min and was told to wait a minute). When I told another person working there the response was only shoulder shrugging.

I think it's a good place to have a chill lunch or dinner, but make sure not to be hungry when you arrive there."
1,Extremely poor service and waiting time >2 hours
1,Food is not good and very small meals
5,"Eaten here a lot and the food is excellent, coffee even better! The venue is really nice spread over several floors, really great place for groups, and the service is excellent! A big thank you to Roni who always had time for a chat and gave us lots of advice of things to do and see in Kathmandu!"
1,"Good place, good ambience, used to love the food but disappointed tonight. Ordered chicken balls and it was semi liquid and really bitter. Complained about it and they said it was because of undercooked stuffings. Didn't want to reorder because my pallette was ruined already. The worst part was that i had to pay for the returned food. Its sad that i have to rethink my go-to place"
5,The food items is most sweetly and i like it
5,"The price to quality ratio here is amazing for the food. They have mastered the dishes like Shakshouka, hummus and pita. Desserts are pretty good and reasonably priced"
5,"The double patty burger was good. Loved peach ice tea. Mixture of apple and peach, very refreshing. Chicken Tacos were not the best."
4,Delicious food but the service was not good
3,"Good food but the pizza was okayish. Pleasant ambience for chill hangouts with friends, family or on a date."
5,"Great, relaxing spot with tasty food, definitely recommend while you're in Kathmandu!"
4,"Sehr schon Ambiente, Essen sehr lecker aber fast schon kalt, Service war so Naja ein wenig befremdlich"
5,Wonderful food. Everything (western & Nepalese type food) we ordered was good. Sat at level 3 - practically in a tree house. Super nice & quiet ambience. Highly recommended. 
5,"A peaceful place for hanging out with your colleagues. Friendly environment and cooperative workers. It is easier to communicate, and the food and the service are top notched.
I tried the bakery chef signature Blueberry Panna cotta. It was so delicious that the flavours contained in it are beautifully displayed."
5,"Attached to Flock Hostel, this is a great spot in the area.
The chicken momo's are delicious too."
5,"Amazing little find for a very good burger! The restaurant itself is tucked away in a quiet street in busy Thamel, it is attached to the Flock Hostel. We came here before our EBC trek and came here on the day we got back to Kathmandu as we loved the burgers so much, the veggie burger is strongly recommended as is the stuffy buff burger (buffalo), portion sizes are very good, super fresh ingredients and really friendly staff and the restaurant itself is beautiful, with multi levels. So glad we found this hidden gem! We will be returning before we leave KTM. There are lots of other good options too especially for veggies :)"
5,Their staff are very friendly and comfortable and easier to communicate with them. Foods and the atmosphere are very friendly. The place is a kind of chill vibing. Chefs should be awarded with some respect because the food they serve is best of all time.
1,J'ai vraiment aime l'endroit. J'ai pris la limonade a la menthe et un burger veger mais malheureusement j'ai eu une severe intoxication alimentaire
3,"La vue est magnifique.
Nous avons commande un bouddha's bowl qui n'etait pas super..tous les legumes coupes grossierement en cube...deux graines qui se battent en duel...assez mediocre pour le prix.
Le lieu en lui-meme est tres accueillant."
5,Delicious food with good atmosphere.. and yummy Tacos.

I loved the pizza
The management is also good
Quick response to any requests"

5,"Nice place, good food, big space for birthday parties and get-togethers with friends and family"
3,"Nice locations

Service delayed"
4,Very good ambient. And foods are tasty too. The bar looks fantastic!
3,"Very good pasta, Room we were in lights was not enoughf, Recommended this place, Parking was there and easy access from main road, If you want to have business meeting in lazimpat area this is perfect place,"
1,I was utterly disappointed with their pasta and pizza. The spaghetti was raw  and dry while the pizza was absolutely average. I hope they work seriously on their menu since the food here does not justify the price ranges they are at.
5,"I dropped by Vinoliva Restaurant & Bar recently and was impressed by its elegant setup and relaxed vibe. The food was delicious, the drinks well-crafted, and the staff welcoming. A perfect spot for a casual hangout or a classy evening out."

1,"One of the worst restaurant I've ever been to.
Waited 1hr 30 mins for pizza. Worst service.
Overpriced"

5,Excellent service
5,"Very best food and service ,outstanding atmosphere !!"
5,"Amazing experience! Warm and friendly atmosphere, delightful ambience. Each dish was bursting with flavors."
5,"Wow..!! really amazing food, mesmerizing ambiance,Great personalized hospitality.. biggest bar...BEST RESTAURANT IN TOWN..!! STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!"
4,"I have been there and have few suggestions.
These can help in customer flow If applied 

Price of Veg Unlimited =  900-1000 ( Let's Assume )
A person cannot eat that much, and 1000 is a little high for a person, so they can't come back often.

BUT ,
If - In 1000 a couple can be involved then it becomes a decent price, so Any couple can spend 900-1000 for 2 people probably on every friday Night coz 450-500 is decent price.

OR, You can just cut the price by half & Make a One time Serve on table ( One time Buffet - on table ).

This will help the same customer come back again and again ( JUST LIKE UTPALA CAFE *** - If you see , it's full of customers almost even evening - due to affordable pricing, while other such restro don't have enough Customer Flow )"
5,"It was an amazing experience
Yummy food,fantastic ambience ,very touching hospitality ..highly recommended restaurant in Uttar Dhoka ."

3,"The environment was good, the food we tried was average."
5,Very friendly staff and lovely food!
4,"The place is good. Has huge bar. There is a pool table too here. Outdoor seating is also available with indoor seating too so the choice is yours. This is also a great place to host a small party of gatherings too. They also serve unlimited food meals in the day time, it's priced per head. There is also a kids play area and the vibe is good."
5,"Food is delicious, service is commendable and environment is remarkable. Worth visiting."
5,Best Restaurant to have some good food and great time in KATHMANDU. Highly recommended!
3,We went and tried there buffet menu comparision to their cost food in buffet was very limited and non veg we paid 850 per head and other mistake we did was didnt check the menu and order few fresh juice which we paid 400 for per glass   .So going  once in blue moon is fine but won't recommend   only thing I liked there service that was quick with cheerful face. Suggestions  either add more food in that cost or reduce the buffet menu

We'd already been to the Roadhouse Cafe in Pokhara and had excellent pizza, so we decided to book at the Roadhouse Hotel in Kathmandu, and we can confirm tonight that we made an excellent choice.

The pulled pork pizza had that perfect balance--tender, juicy pork with just the right smoky sweetness that paired beautifully with the cheese. The pepperoni pizza was exactly how it should be: crispy edges, rich flavor, and every bite packed with that satisfying punch.

On top of the food, the service really made the experience. Miss Astha went above and beyond--attentive, friendly, and professional throughout. It's rare to have such flawless service where you feel genuinely taken care of. The combination of great food and her perfect service made the whole visit memorable.

5,"Recently had dinner at Yala Cafe & Coffee Shop, and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The cozy atmosphere and warm hospitality made it a perfect spot to unwind in the evening.

I tried their grilled chicken with sauteed vegetables and a side of mashed potatoes - it was flavorful, well-portioned, and beautifully presented. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the seasoning was just right. I also enjoyed a glass of their homemade iced tea, which was refreshing and not overly sweet.

The staff were attentive and friendly, always checking in to ensure everything was to our liking. The service was quick, but we never felt rushed.

If you're looking for a peaceful dinner spot in Kathmandu with good vibes, delicious food, and excellent service, I highly recommend Yala Cafe. Definitely coming back again!"
5,"Good food, reasonable price, good servers, good place to sit and enjoy a meal. since both me and my husband eat little portions, it's great they were okay that we shared a single thali."
5,"I visited this Cafe in Thamel and ordered a lassi and the Nepali thali. The lassi was refreshing, and the thali had all the usual components--tasty and satisfying, though not extraordinary. What stood out was the warm and polite service. The staff were attentive, and I appreciated that they accepted Indian Rupees (INR), which made things easier for me as a traveler. The cafe has a relaxed vibe, making it a nice spot to unwind. While not the most exceptional in Thamel, it's a good place for a peaceful meal and friendly service if you're nearby."
5,"One of the best restaurant in thamel , Kathmandu we went there for our lunch and we got very delicious meals and their hospitality was really great.we will definitely keep coming back"

If you are looking for a peaceful place for a dinner and genuine hospality I highly recommend it."
4,"I had a wonderful visit to Yala Cafe, a peaceful gem tucked down a quiet alley in Thamel. The charming outdoor seating area surrounded by greenery creates a lovely setting to enjoy your morning brew or a relaxed afternoon bite . The ambiance strikes a perfect balance between cozy and bright, blending traditional touches with modern flair .

The menu is thoughtfully curated--from hearty breakfasts like Eggs Benedict, country breakfasts, and pancakes, to a range of Nepali and international dishes at lunch and dinner . I especially enjoyed the Sunny Morning Power breakfast with sauteed veggies and a side of fresh juice, plus the house-made espresso using Nepali beans. The coffee was smooth and aromatic, and their teas, particularly the Ilam black and masala chai, were flavorful and comforting .

Service was friendly, attentive, and genuinely warm--staff happily recommended dishes and offered tweaks, creating a genuine hospitality vibe . I've also read that tourists appreciate not just the service but also the insight and travel tips shared by staff .

A couple of minor drawbacks: prices are slightly above average for the area, especially dinners, and it can get busy during peak hours (though the wait is worth it if you snag a seat in the courtyard). A few dishes felt just shy of perfection, but most were consistently delicious.

Overall: Yala Cafe earns a solid 4 stars for its relaxing atmosphere, fresh and varied menu, high-quality coffee and tea, and warm service. It's a must-visit whether you're grabbing breakfast, unwinding with a drink, or lounging over lunch. Minor tweaks to pricing and kitchen consistency could elevate it even further, but it's already a standout in Kathmandu's cafe scene."
5,"The food and service here were wonderful, I had to visit twice during my few days in Nepal. The banana porridge was among my favorites...hot, creamy and full of flavor in the best way. I had a few other items from a menu including the puri and pancake with honey. I definitely ordered more than I should have on my first visit but glad I was able to enjoy all the deliciousness. The service was excellent as well. My server recognized me the second time around and he was just as wonderfully attentive as he was during my initial visit. Highly recommend!"
5,I'd definitely recommend yala cafe to anyone looking for great food and good service.
5,"We went for breakfast and really enjoyed the food, the excellent service and the prices are affordable. recommend yala cafe for the best breakfast or brunch in thamel."
5,"Yala Cafe truly served one of the best breakfasts I've had in Nepal! The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. From the perfectly brewed coffee to the delicious local and international breakfast options, everything was on point.

The garden setting added so much to the experience--calm, peaceful, and a perfect start to the day. The staff were warm, welcoming, and attentive, making the whole visit feel special.

If you're in Nepal and looking for a place to enjoy a relaxing morning with great food and ambiance, Yala Cafe is definitely the spot. Highly recommended!"
5,"I recently visited Yala Cafe with a group of friends, and it was an amazing experience from start to finish. The staff managed a table for us so beautifully, making sure we were comfortable and well taken care of.

The garden setting was calm and peaceful, creating the perfect atmosphere for catching up and relaxing. The food was delicious, and the service was fast, friendly, and professional. Their hospitality was truly top-notch--it made us feel genuinely welcomed.

Whether you're going solo or with friends, Yala Cafe is a must-visit for anyone looking for great vibes, tasty food, and a peaceful environment highly recommended"
5,"I recently visited Yala Cafe and had such a wonderful time. The garden area is so calm and peaceful--it truly feels like a little escape from the noise of daily life. Sitting there surrounded by greenery was incredibly relaxing.

5,I highly recommend this place for quality food and service . Staff are very friendly and always ready to service. Food is very tasty and hygienic.
5,"Decent eggs Benedict probably could benefit from a different type of bread, and pancakes were good. Nice atmosphere and good customer service. A little higher priced than other places nearby. They take credit cards at a 4% charge"
1,service is good but food is totally waste of money
5,"There's a funny little story connected to this place. I came here with my friend after a morning hike -- and while sitting down, I suddenly noticed that my foot was bleeding.
It turned out I had been bitten by a leech during the hike, and it must have fallen off on its own -- I didn't even notice it. That's probably why the bleeding started later, right there at the cafe.

My friend asked the staff if they had a first aid kit, and they immediately rushed over to help. It wasn't anything serious, just a small thing -- but their care and kindness made a big impression.
10 stars for customer service! Huge thanks to them.

Oh, and by the way -- the food is super delicious, and you can sit in a lovely open-air courtyard.

Highly recommended!"
5,Amazing cute cafe that offers wonderful drinks and delicious meals. Came here for breakfast and had the local breakfast with a latte and it was a filling and hearty way to start the day. Great service and wonderful outdoor seating. They offer indoor as well.
5,This place is a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the neighboring street. Had the breakfast and it came with your choice of tea or reduced coffee price.

5,"We had a vegetable pakauda as an appetizer, and yala south Asian chicken curry and chicken Kantipur choila fusion for mains. All of them were really good. The portions were ok, not very big but definitely adequate. These 3 dishes and a large beer costed around 2400 nad, not the cheapest place in town but worth it. Waiters were very friendly and the service prompt."
4,"banana lassi was the best I have had in town. Egg benedict was ok, too much onions not much other veggies. Too much tough skin and most fat in the pork curry I had. Very friendly and helpful staff"

4,We had a wonderful Teej celebration yesterday with 25 people in the terrace of Satkar fine dine. Snacks was very different with live stations of pani puri chaat and kebabs...everyone loved crispy corn. We were happy to see enough human resources allocated despite other parties going around downstairs. We danced for almost 5hours followed by delicious dinner. Location is easily accessible  few meters from main road.So I give a 5 star for the ambience service and a 4 for food main course was bit salty and spicy otherwise everything was very good. Much recommended for gatherings.

The staff were attentive, but it might come off as some sort of being watched, but it shouldn't bother much as it might be their job description. Although the first service was a bit late, the food was good. The plating was first-class. I liked the peach ice tea. We ordered Kurkure Chicken and Cheese Balls as an appetizer along with Mo:mo: and Pizza for the main."

I loved Saffron rice which is under the Irani menu and you gotta try their Grilled Prawn, its a must!! I have these everytime and it has never disappointed me. They can think to increase their items in the menu for the future.

Even more than food I am very much impressed by their customer service. All the staffs and team are very attentive and helpful especially Sagar. His service is very professional and always eager to serve customers best."

1,"Unacceptable Service - Never Again!

I had one of the worst experiences with this  fine dine . The service was extremely slow, with no regard for customers' time. The staff were rude and dismissive, acting as if they were doing us a favor instead of providing basic service. Their cheap manners and unprofessional attitude made the entire experience frustrating.

If you're looking for quality service, I strongly recommend avoiding this place. They seriously need to improve their customer service, staff training, and professionalism. A complete disappointment!"

The ambiance was equally impressive - warm, inviting, and perfect for a night out with friends or a romantic evening. The decor was tasteful, and the overall vibe was relaxed and sophisticated.

5,"The excellent Resturant in Kathmandu.

Delicious food, lovely ambiance, and friendly service. Really enjoyed the dinner - great taste and warm hospitality!"
5,"I have had a very good experience with Gaia Restaurant and its food. Gaia has always focused on quality and hygiene. I must have had lunch and dinner there over 100 times, sometimes with clients and sometimes with family, and we have never felt the food was unhealthy. These days, there is a lot of competition to make food taste good, but I personally prefer healthy food without preservatives.

I have seen some reviews about Gaia, but I always recommend Gaia for its healthy and hygienic food, excellent service, and amazing ambience with a beautiful garden."
5,"A beautiful place
friendly atmosphere
Reasonable price"
1,"The vegetarian thali set at this restaurant is significantly overpriced (790 NPR) given its very poor taste. Several standard ingredients were missing, which was disappointing. We've tried many thali sets in Kathmandu, often for less than 650 NPR, and unfortunately, this one was by far the most underwhelming."
5,"Best resturant in Kathmandu.
The food service and staff are  so good. The garden can't explan ."
1,"Very bad experience with the cafe we ordered a veg sandwich and they literally gave me bread with lettuce when we told him it doesn't look like a sandwich the guy who served replied ohh really what a pathetic answer and pathetic food.and the price of one piece of sandwich is like 870
Never ever visit the kind of place."
1,"An extremely overpriced place and not good food. We understand a place charging high but there wasn't any value for money here and the portion sizes weren't justified. We ordered 2 sandwiches grilled chicken - was extremely dry overcooked chicken, stale bread and zero seasoning/flavour. The vegetarian sandwhich wasn't good either, the lettuce wasn't fresh, very grainy bread. Only thing worthy was the coffee which was decent. Highly evaluate before visiting this place."
5,"I have visited Gaia several times must of the time I visited with friends and family, the foods quality is very good staff are so friendly. The place very clean."
5,One of the best Restaurant in Kathmandu.
5,"Best Restaurant Thamel Kathmandu Nepal .
I have goon in Gaia several times. This  year with my best clients. Gaia's services is best and be better nice food and garden."
5,"Wonderful Breakfast Experience at Gaia Restaurant

I visited Gaia Restaurant this morning for breakfast, and it was an excellent experience. The breakfast was delicious, and the coffee was just perfect. The garden is beautiful and full of greenery, creating a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.

The staff were very friendly and welcoming, which made the visit even more enjoyable. I had a small meeting with my friends there, and the setting was ideal for it. Before leaving, I ordered a chicken burger and a pizza to take away for my family--I'm sure they will love it!

I highly recommend Gaia Restaurant to anyone looking for great food, a lovely environment, and warm service."

5,"I went out for dinner and drinks two days in a row here, the service is impeccable and the servers really take interest! recommend this place especially for tourists visiting kathmandu for the first time"
5,"Gaia is a lovely little oasis in chaotic Thamel. Looking for a 'safe' option after an earlier tummy upset, I had the marinated chicken fillet on roast potatoes and it was divine, along with a very refreshing lemon soda on ice. The service is also exceptional. The courtyard is very pleasant during the day and the ambience at night is also lovely, I stopped in for a drink last night. You won't regret a meal here during your stay in Kathmandu."
5,"Super friendly and attentive staff, really nice food and atmosphere and central location in Thamel :)"
5,"Excellent food and service and very nice place. If not the best , one of the best foods we had in Nepal in 12 days . Prices  are also reasonable
Highly recommended. Thank you"
5,"Ik heb hier alleen gegeten en heb het ontzettend fijn gehad hier. Alles was top: sfeer was gezellig, eten was lekker en service was goed. Prijs kwaliteit is ook zeker oke. Ik kom hier zeker terug als ik in Nepal ben. De plek is rustig en in een steegje waar niet veel mensen of auto's langskomen. Alles was simpelweg top. Dankjewel voor deze fijne avond"
5,We were the only customers when we arrived late afternoon so I was a bit nervous if we made a mistake coming here. But. The service was very prompt and friendly. Then our food arrived and it tasted like heavenly soul food ! We ordered the chicken breast smothered in a delicious sauce and a vegetable dish. We stuck with non alcoholic drinks. People were arriving when we were leaving. Highly recommended !
5,"Good food, big portions of chicken sizzler. Excellent service. Nice atmosphere."
5,"I had a great time in Gaia Restaurant,Its a good environment with the garden.
All the members of the restaurant staff are very friendly. Foods are so good and testy

5,Very nice quiet place! We had our breakfast at Gaia Restaurant many times during our stay in Kathmandu. We found the food and coffee to be very good! Especially we as Scandinavians enjoyed the homemade dark toast which was far better than any bread we have had in Asia:)
5,"Excellent place for any meal! Everytime I go it is very relaxed. However, I am served and attended to immediately. There is a good variety of items on the menu from different cuisines. Will definitely come back during my stay in Kathmandu. Thank you!"

5,"Gaia Restaurant, located in the heart of Thamel, truly stands out as one of the best dining spots in the area. As someone who frequently visits various restaurants with clients for lunch or dinner, I can confidently say Gaia consistently exceeds expectations.

Most of my clients are from Europe, and they often rave about the quality of the food at Gaia. The pizza, lasagna, sizzlers, and fresh salads are always a hit. Each dish is crafted with care and bursting with flavor.

The staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive, always ensuring a pleasant dining experience. The ambiance of the restaurant adds to its charm--calm, welcoming, and perfect for both casual and formal gatherings.

Gaia has become a trusted choice for me and my clients. If you're in Thamel and looking for delicious food paired with great service, Gaia Restaurant is a must-visit!"
5,"I really like their veg chowmin!
Veg Momo also looks good and yummy!
Good location, atmosphere and service, thank you!"
5,"The place,services and talking about food is rlly delicious people are very friendly and I love this place ."
5,Fast service
5,Belle ambiance. Personnel sympathique. Cuisine
4,"Food and ambience was great. It took forever for the food to arrive though, I had to wait close to an hour. :( I guess it's because it was close to Tihar and they were short-staffed but I wish they communicated that earlier so that I could plan around it.

(Tawa chicken was criminally good)"
5,Absolutely loved this place! We came here every day while in Thamel and had a great experience every time. Food tasted great and service was excellent.
5,"We really enjoyed Gaia Restaurant during our Honey Moon, it is actually the only restaurant in Nepal in which we repeated, and we did it 3 times!

The food is excellent, the prices are fair and the attention is great, specially from Sanjog Puri who served us professionally, sweetly and kindly.

Hope we can come back!"
5,"We had visited the Hard Rock Cafe in Kathmandu the previous evening & had a shockingly bad experience, so the Gaia restaurant was a joy in terms of a smooth, friendly service, with excellent food & atmosphere for our party of 8, which, despite them being packed out, they provided attentive service throughout. We would all definitely recommend, and are disappointed to have only found this place on our last night in Kathmandu."
2,"Freundlicher Service, aber langweilige, wenig gewurzte ""eurasische"" Kuche fur Touristen, die bloss nichts ungewohntes Essen wollen.
Sichuan Beef war gar nicht scharf und hatte kaum etwas mit dem eigentlichen Gericht gemeinsam. Zu 8 warteten wir ca. 1h auf das Essen. Zumindest der Nepali Masala Tee war lecker. Preislich war es in Ordnung"
5,"Gaia Restaurant is a hidden gem on the side of Thamel.

It offers a peaceful garden setting and serves fresh, healthy food. While orders may take a bit longer to prepare, the wait is well worth it, as the meals are packed with benefits for your health. The service is excellent, and the staff are incredibly friendly.

As someone who runs a travel company and brings customers from all over the world, I've visited Gaia many times. My clients always love the restaurant and its food. I highly recommend Gaia Restaurant!"
2,Mediocre food at best. And the service was annoying together with a bad dish we got.
4,Very nice meal
3,"We had dinner at the restaurant. The food  was ok, but was spicy though we asked for non spicy dish.  .... It took more than an hour to get our dishes.  Won't eat there again."

5,Hidden gem in the corner with the perfect style. The food were absolutely great. The staff were friendly. Nice atmosphere.
5,Gaia was near our hotel so we ended up there first out of convenience. I had the chicken satay for lunch and it was great. The chicken was moist and cooked well. My partner had the chicken chilli- also very tasty. It was more like a Chinese sweet and sour than a spicy dish. We ended up eating there again for dinner the same day. I had the farm house chicken. It was nice to have a bit of comfort food during our travels. We also ordered the pork chop which was excellent. Another highlight is the environment of the restaurant. It is such a pleasant garden passion and it was full. Always a good sign when a restaurant has to turn people away.
5,"Very  nine Restaurant in Kathmandu fresh and tasty foods and drinks ,"
5,"In our week in Kathmandu, this was the one restaurant we made it a point to visit twice. We loved the garden atmosphere, the service was fantastic, and the food was so delicious. The aloo sadeko and paneer tikka butter masala were especially good. You could tell they take the quality of their food very seriously."
5,Excellente cuisine
5,"Peaceful cafe down a side street. Excellent coffee, mint and ginger cooler, and eggs benny."
5,"Very good Restaurant in Thamail kathmandu Nepali. The ford's, Service, staffs, ambience, are very very good the garden is the best."
1,Prices are too high. Additional 10% vat on the menu prices is horrible. Waited 40 mins for the French fries. Find the alternative if you are new in the town.
3,O lugar e bom. A comida mediana. O preco nao e justo pelo que e cobrado.
5,"One of my favourite places for hanging out with my friends, great organic coffee and apple pie with ice-cream , I also love momos here ."

5,"Tres bon repas au Gaia restaurant avec un tres bon rapport qualite prix. Les plats sont copieux et pas trop epices.
Nous nous sommes regales !"
4,"I went there with my colleague for lunch. The Vegetable Pad Thai Noodles was delicious and full of flavor. My colleague chose the Chicken Chili, and she said it was good too. (me a veg guy lol)

The place is perfect for a corporate lunch. The ambiance is great, and the service is efficient. I would definitely come here for family gatherings as well. It offers good food and a pleasant semi-fine dining experience."

5,"Lugar tranquilo en el centro de Thamel, tiene terraza muy agradable con musica ambiente , la comida bien preparada, personal cordial y atento. Frecuentado por turistas y locales. Recomendable. No utilice servicio de alojamiento, por lo que no puedo opinar."
5,The atmosphere in this garden restaurant is so nice. I felt happy here. And the staff is very kind.
5,Best restaurants in thamel good food friendly service best garden in thamel.
1,"Need to train staffs to become more hospitable, there's a difference in treatment with  locals and foreigners. This culture obviously comes from the owners to the staffs, same is situation with most places in Nepal."
5,"Great location, food is pricy but good, good vive, washroom is clean, people are friendly"
5,"We like Momo, and you can pick veg or chicken
We like ginger lemon tea here
The service are excellent too "
5,"Top Momos and friendly, attentive Service :)"
4,"The food was tasty, but unfortunately a bit cold. Staff is nice. Prices are above Kathmandu average ;-)"
2,"Joli cafe au calme ,bonne nourriture mais toilettes affreusement sales .
S ils ont les memes notions d hygiene dans la cuisine...."
1,"We ordered 3 items..the first item chips chilly was fine. Then we ordered a thai green curry which had a weird taste to it and it wasn't authentic at all, after complaining..the staff used sarcasm instead of changing it. The last time, chicken sizzler, the meat wasn't cooked properly and the gravy was not at all to the mark. The only reason was stayed was the live music playing."
5,"Very good tasty food with great service and staff is very helpful. Good ambiance with coziness and warmth.
We tried Thukpa first time and it was very tasty, Himalayan potato was yummy too.
Tofu Choila was flavourful and interesting, very much like a paneer vegetable dish."
5,"Great food, very quick service. Open fire makes a lot of difference on a chilly night."
5,A cozy restaurant nestled away from the hustle of the city. Staff is very friendly and kind. They have the best Thai Green Curry!!
2,Nel quartiere di Thamel. Locale carino all'aperto. Servizio buono. Cibo nepalese e indiano. Caro rispetto agli standard del luogo.
4,"In the midst of craziness of Thamel, cafe Mitra serves a cozy, quiet and comfortable dining experience. We enjoyed salads which came with the momos and curry plates. Chicken Tikka butter masala was delicious and soup chicken momo was lovely. Momo chutney was yummy, probably the best we have come across in our whole trip in Kathmandu. However, Danish pork chop was a bit dry, paneer spinach dish was really salty for our liking, roti tasted like a pre-done doughy flat-bread, and Nepali curry was a meh. I would also not get cappuccino and masala chiya here again. They were both average at best. Overall, a good experience with the atmosphere and greens."

4,Came for dinner: A nice little square to sit and eat--- great environment. Definitely touristy but Nepali food too. Attentive polite staff but a bit on the expensive side.
5,"Vkusno . Russkoe kafe v Katmandu, zdes kakoe-tomesto vstrechi russkih turistov. Shikarnyy dal bat."
5,"Heerlijke oase van rust aan de drukke straat van Thamel.
Koude droge witte wijn verkrijgbaar."
5,Very cute and peaceful place in the heart of busy and noisy Thamel. You instantly feel good when you inter this little oasis of a cafe. Go sit on the 2nd floor patio at the very back. Food is good ans staff is friendly/respectful. I'm sad I discovered this cafe when I was about to go back to my country.
4,After five nights in Kathmandu this remained one of my favorite cafes. The patio is pleasant and relaxing in the midst of Thamel activity. The service was friendly. The good was tasty and most importantly the cleanliness was excellent. Will definitely come again.
3,Cafe with a nice little backyard with trees. Cafe and meal are decent. Prices are on the higher side. Unclear if AC is available during hot summers. Their constant faint music is annoying though.
1,"The music is really loud, I have headache there"
1,The music is very loud and annoying
5,"Restaurant located in thamel, They serve a huge n delicious portion of avocado salad, breakfast options are also quite good. One of the descent places in thamel for breakfast, lunch and dinner"
5,"Everything about the visit was great, including the tasty cuisine, attentive service, and quaint setting. ""We had a great time eating at Cafe Mitra and Lounge Bar. Everything was handled really nicely from the time we arrived until we departed. I'm grateful to the group for organizing such a positive trip. We will visit soon..."
5,"The Nepali thali was excellent, as a Tamilian I enjoyed it.

Gulab Jamun was given in curd, but don't  judge the book by it's cover. It was better than Gulab Jamun in ice cream."
5,"Walked into this place after a tatoo and piercing. We truly enjoyed the meals, best salad in Thamel, hands down! A must try, their mint lemonades are amazing!!!  Excellent service and fresh food, what else do we need?"
5,"Restaurant bar in a court in between 2 buildings of a busy commercial street in Thamel, that offers a light breeze during the hot season with some shade and a terrasse with some space dedicated as a non-smoking area.
The service is really good. Waiters are attentive and efficient, speak good English.
The menu offers a large span with some suprizing options such as salmon or ostreich. We tried the avocado salad which was really flavory and satisfying. Momos (local dumplings) are tasty and rich in local spices.
We were not sarisfied with the lassi, which were too watery (plain and mango).
--
In overall the place is in line with other comments we read and we enjoyed our meal."
3,"We had dinner here. Ordered two of the Thai options. The food was nice, and it came out in a decent time. I wouldn't say it was authentic Thai, but it was still tasty. We sat outside in a small courtyard with trees over hanging, which was nice. There was also a large projector screen  showing the Euros Football."
5,"Buona cucina e piatti ben presentati, Personale rilassato e non invadente.
Caldamente consigliato"
3,"I visited the cafe twice a week. on the 1st visit, I had ""avocado & tomato toast"" which is 325ruphia as breakfast with Mr.Kim who is one of my high school friends. hot americano was normal. on the 2nd visit, I ate ""Famous Indian Vegetarian Biryani"" which is 595Rs as lunch alone.

Price is not affordable. Ambience is great.

Great ambience makes me go for a beer with Nepalese friend in the evening. It seems to be a gorgeous place to enjoy Gorkha with genuine people. It is spacious and roomy."
3,Food Price wise is a bit costly in comparison to other restaurants in thamel. Food is okay
5,Avocado and dragon fruit salad was really good. Didn't even need the dressing.

2,"Solo fui a comer, los precios me parecieron algo altos en comparacion a otros sitios similares dentro de Thamel, agradezco de todas maneras que hayan tenido Pad Thai, para escapar un poco de la comida Nepali e Hindu ya Que llevo un largo tiempo por aca. pero el gran problema fue que se paseo una rata al lado mio . De todas maneras no los destruyo, porque el lugar en si, es bastante abierto y puede ser propenso, pero de todas maneras tienen que tener ojo con eso, a mi personalmente no me afecto mucho, y afortunadamente nadie mas lo vio por el bien del local"
5,Amazing breakfast 
5,"Best butter chicken tikka masala, I've ever tried! Great service and atmosphere, reasonable prices"
5,"Love this place! Chilled, friendly and helpful staff. Food is delicious - their fruit juices, momo's and avocado/dragon fruit salad. We came here after 2 weeks trekking and were craving some fruit/veg - salad was amazing. Way back in 2019 we also visited this place and it sure has kept up its mark - tasty food, friendly service etc. Thank you!"
5,"Great live music, atmosphere and healty food"
5,"Amazing food, insane cheap prices and cute terrace! We came here multiple times during our stay in thamel! Coffees are delicious and super affordable :)"
5,"Really good quality food. I had the avocado and dragon fruit salad and it was very filling, healthy and delicious. The service is good, the place is very relaxing and chill. Prices are higher than average in Kathmandu, even for Thamel. It's worth it if you want salads or healthy food."
5,Awesome ambience
1,"Massiges Preis-/ Leistungsverhaltnis, das Bestellte wird in unserem Fall durch etwas anderes getauscht, in der Hoffnung, der doofe Tourist merkt es nicht, wenn doch, steht der arme Kellner da, um sich die Beschwerde anzuhoren und das Kuchenpersonal lacht im Hintergrund .... Fazit: nicht zu empfehlen."
5,"Excellent place!!! Not prominently visible but only the good option we found among few others in Thamil -quality, taste, price"
5,This is a great restaurant with many menu choices. Everything I've eaten here was great. The service is good too.
5,Great music and mulled wine. Perfect for Valentine's Day
5,"Zahodili posle treka poest. Margarita- to est kokteyl- chudesnaya, steyk- vkusnyy, obsluzhivanie ochen neplohoe. Rekomenduyu)"
3,They have beer
5,Nuestro lugar favorito para comer y desconectar de kathmandu!! Volveremos siempre que podamos! 
5,Sehr nettes Nepalesisches Cafe. Schoner Gastgarten. Toiletten sind sehr sauber. Bedienung ist Top! Die Preise sind auch O.K. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefuhlt!
5,"Wonderful cafe with candles on each tables. Colourful and joyful environment. Best for celebrating birthdays, parties with friends. Had amazing tea."
3,"The ambience may make it worthit for special occasions. The food itself lacks any taste whatsoever. Whether you can justify that for the price depends on who you are.
The rest is as advertised and our experience seems to be consistent with other reviews (except the ones praising food)"
1,VERY BAD STAFF SERVICE
5,Had the lamb it was amazing the sauce was fantastic. The service was good and it's good value for money.
5,Loved the eating n shopping options in this location
5,"Have been to this restaurant many times! The food here is really so good, same as the overall environment!"
5,"There are very few places still remaining with this level of atmosphere. It feels like dining in a castle courtyard, as advertised. This fine-dining restaurant did not disappoint in taste or presentation; very healthy meal options were available.

Definitely a place I would recommend for special occasions."
4,"It was ok, and the service was friendly, but we did not really enjoy the food so much."
1,For Service i'll rate 0
4,"Love this precinct Baba Mahal shops. Mulchowk is situated in a nice peaceful courtyard. Good food, good coffee (my pet hate tho...tiny coffee cups )"
1,Disrespectful towards guests.
4,On expensive side but great ambiance and food's taste makes it worth it.
4,They have improved a lot. There are more food to choose from. The best food they have is spinach stuffed chicken.
5,Quite place to chat with friends.
5,Wow forget less services...
3,"The environment of the place is incredible, Babermahal compound, but the restaurant itself is of weak game in comparison of the others in this qualitative place. The welcome and service were impeccable, although we kept seeing kitchen staff coming and going in the park...
But the big disappointment came from the food, which was as disappointing as the mediocre cocktails. The coffee service took a long time even though there were only a few customers there, as I imagine is often the case...
Only one toilet to share for everyone and no water on tap... with a view over the back yard of the kitchens in passing.
In short, a mediocre experience given the setting."
4,"Stepping into this restaurant feels like entering a different era, with its beautiful courtyard and classical building that exude charm and elegance. The ambience is unmatched, creating a memorable dining experience. While the parking could be better managed, the overall tranquility and ambiance make up for it. The prices are on the higher side, but the experience is worth every penny for a special occasion."
1,"The worst food I would say. You can get the same quality and taste in any other local khaja ghar and cafes. Bad food, bad service and bad atmosphere. Better to visit some other place rather than this!!"
4,Nice environment. Foods tastes good
5,"My family and friends, we all enjoy having our brunch at this restaurant. The sound atmosphere is awesome."
2,The food was disappointing for the price. Toooo basic. Standard dherai tala jhareycha paila bhanda. No wonder the place was empty.
1,"Not satisfied at all , wannabe penthouse "
5,"I love the ambiance here, the welcoming and romantic looking place. The food is amazing, the service is great.
It gets crowded mlst of the time (when i visit).
Definitely a place for a great evening."
2,"I had my event  here on Dec 7. Venue is not suitable for big functions. Very unorganised and slow service.
Expected better from the venue but ended up being disappointed.

Didnot deliver the service as they promised.

Very disheartened as the it kind of ruined my function. We ended up being Embarrassed

Happy to discuss with management if they would like."
2,Incredibly overpriced & terrible food!!!
2,"I went to Mul chowk resturant with my family. Atmosphere and customer service was quite good and food was alright . However, when we received the bill I saw 13% VAT added. As I came to Nepal after half a decade I had very vague idea about if I should be paying additional VAT therefore I asked the waiter about it. Waiter seemed very confused and babbled irrational reasons for additional VAT. I was not able to see manager as waiter tried to diffuse the situation with invalid explanations. When I came home and run down through the law, I picked that no restaurants are allowed to add additional VAT(legally) and is reportable in case of non-compliance. It's disheartening to see how restaurants are going against law to make money out of their own people. Would love to see an explanation on this matter from owner and happy to be contacted ."
5,"Very good, with warm service and excellent ambience!"
1,Visited a while back. Staff were extremely rude.. i think he was the gardener or guard or someone. Was a special day and ruined our whole vibe.
5,"The restaurant has a beautiful environment, the taste of the food is too good . The service provided is excellent "
4,"Service is awesome, and food was delicious, must try out"
5,Great
2,"Visited this place in the evening to try it out. It's quiet and peaceful, good for a date. Considering the pricing though, I must say that things weren't up to the mark. You can get better food for way more reasonable pricing all around Kathmandu, especially the Jhamsikhel and Thamel areas.

Bruschetta: The worst I have had in quite some time. It was literally just diced tomatoes on top of 5 small pieces of bread. I expected better.

Wine Glazed Chicken: Came with a side of mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. It was juicy but super bland.

Spaghetti: The spaghetti was undercooked and there was no salt. Again, tasted very bland and we weren't able to eat all of it even though both of us were super hungry.

Other aspects: The service itself was good and the staff were friendly + helpful. The toilet was super disappointing and exhibited a clear lack of regular cleaning and maintenance. Overall, if it's value for money you're looking for, this is probably not the place. The experience and especially the food was quite disappointing."
5,Great space for eating out in a quite location inside an old durbar. Excellent for small parties. Loved the appetizers and buffet menu. Beats banquet and party palace food anyday at a good price.
5,"Best place in KTM for fine dining. Prices are on the higher side but it is a c
Value for money place if you want to experience fine dining."
5,"We had a great meal here. The presentation is excellent, the service is excellent and we really enjoyed our meals."
5,Experience the life style of Ranas.
5,So many good dishes here but the most memorable for me was definitely the mustang potatoes its been months and I still think about it.
5,Visited this place yesterday. Although it was a rainy day. The vibe was amazing. Menu is priced on the higher side but the ambience makes it even. Attentive staff...will visit again.
3,"The location is beautiful but we were a little disappointed. We ordered 2 vegetarian breakfasts which came out lukewarm at best. The tea and coffee were fine but very small cups. The waiters weren't very attentive and we had to find someone to pay. The toilets within the area were horrendous - mosquitos, no tissue paper and no running water to wash hands which really put us off. I don't think we will be back which is a shame because it's a lovely location"
4,Ambiance is magical. Perfect romantic place.
5,Amazing place
5,"Amazing food, nice atmosphere, lovely staff, beautiful place"
2,"Food was not good.

5,"Best of the Best! The food was good, the ambiance was perfect and A Must go to place for pictures and Videos aa well."
4,"Delicious food , we were recommended here and it was worth it"
4,"Loved all the food except the vegetable sandwich; it was a tad too dry and bland to my liking.
The ambience is  but the parking situation isn't proper."
4,This restaurant in Babarmahal revisited has a really beautiful ambience especially when seating outdoors.... the food is excellent and really tasty... service was good as well... although a bit on the costly side... the food and ambience are worth it.... definitely a great place for a date...
1,its degrading
4,A diminutive palace turned into restaurant with antiquity and historic magnificence that exhudes grandeur and idyllic atmosphere within the proximity of federal secretariat!
1,"Had Roasted pork belly and it was the most terrible food I ever ate!
Horrible snacks as well.
Very disappointed for the price they charge."
4,"Good ambience, neoclassical building with central courtyard. Nice food, helpful staffs,
Slightly expensive.."
5,Hospitality was nice food was amazing some of the best food i have tired. Food was so great i forgot to take pictures.
4,"Used to have great food but service and food quality seems to have dropped of late. Maybe it was just a bad in the office for them? I don't know but I was definitely disappointed the last time I went. Still worth a visit but too risky an option for important events.

It's on the more expensive side however the service and the thali make up for it.Their dhal and their mutton gravy was a star for the show for me, I usually dun go for second servings but I had to eat them twice because they were so well made!!!
As for their drinks, their lassi is very delicious however their Japanese matcha bubble tea was a let down, they definitely need to improve on their bubble teas.
Their staff service is exceptional, and are all so friendly and ready to help. Loved that the whole restaurant is so clean and well organised.
I definitely think everyone should come and give Jimbu Thakali a go!"

4,"Outstanding Veg Thakali and Exceptional Service

One of the best vegetarian Thakali meals I've had in Nepal--flavorful, authentic, and truly satisfying. While the pricing is equal to typical local eateries, the quality of food and overall experience fully justify the cost.

The restaurant offers a warm, cosy ambiance with a mix of indoor and outdoor booth-style seating, as well as relaxed seating near the bar. The service was excellent throughout, with special thanks to Anusha for her attentive and friendly approach.

A wonderful spot for both locals and visitors--I'll definitely be returning."

5,The service by Nilima was great and so was the food
4,The food was great would definitely recommend
4,"The food is decent. The hamburger I ordered is okay, but I wouldn't say it is worthy of the price. The prices at this property is a bit expensive (I can afford but I can easily find cheaper substitutes in Kathmandu). The restaurant supports QR payment, which also supports Alipay Zhi Fu Bao. However one thing I was a bit uncomfortable about was that the waiter seemed not to trust me that I had made the payment since I showed him the screen page on my phone confirming the payment was successful, then he walked to somewhere idk. And later he came back and kindly requested to take a picture of the successful payment page. I mean it is understandable to check if the payment was through, but I suppose they could do on their computer or something; this kind of gesture made me wonder if I was trusted by the people at the property."
5,"Great food, good value and quite a variety of meals. Been twice and will go again before I leave"
5,Very beautiful food and service.  Highly recommend.  Must visit.  Srijana our server was absolutely amazing. Very polite and energetic.

Prices were reasonable for the quality. Overall, I had a great experience and would happily go back."

""Absolutely blown away!
From the moment we stepped inside, the ambiance was enchanting. The decor was stunning, creating an intimate and sophisticated atmosphere. Our server was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable, offering excellent recommendations.
But the real star of the show was the food. Every dish was a masterpiece - beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. We started with the chilli chicken pizza, which was simply divine. For our mains, I had the rolling kebab with naan and my partner had the paneer pasandida with garlic naam. Both were cooked to perfection and incredibly flavorful.
Highly recommend!"

5,"For over a decade, I have been a loyal customer of this exceptional establishment. I have never been disappointed by their food, service, or ambiance. While we arrived late, all the table is already over and it's empty ..the overall experience was still enjoyable& so peaceful. The restaurant's environment is truly remarkable and has garnered a reputation for excellence. Notably, it is the first revolving restaurant in Nepal. The combination of delectable cuisine and a humble owner makes it a truly unique and memorable dining experience. I am eager to bring an event to this restaurant in the near future. Thank you once again for your exceptional service."
1,There was customer who requested to stop revolving and you stopped it instead of kicking him out. People not only come there for your food they come to experience revolving restaurant.
4,"Good place. Good food.
It's a rotating restaurant, we requested owner to show us the demo and it was amazing.
It's 23 years old restaurant in the heart of city.
Note: there is no elevator, it's a very old building but the restaurant is good. Do visit and enjoy dining."

3,"While the food tasted ok, service was very slow and we had to try and get the waiters attention on a number of occasions as they weren't attentive or would constantly disappear."
4,Its nice.
1,Prices are too expensive
4,hangout time...with best view..
5,Best momos we had in kathmandu. Unpretentious and delicious.
5,"If you're looking for something local, this is the place to be. Nothing fancy, just good food and a beers with friendly staff!"
4,A bit costlier than other similar tibetan restaurants but overall okay.
5,"The single best family run Restaurant that serves really good food, without hurting your tummy or wallet!"
3,"Restaurante muy basico, con una atencion amable pero nada especial"
5,"Delicious restaurant with healthy, safe and tasty food. It's a really authentic environment, also clean and cheap. Definitely recommended."
4,Thenduk is pretty delicious. I did a take out. The restaurant should use a box instead of plastic bag to pack hot items.
4,"Barahsinghe - craft beer, a pilsner that tastes surprisingly like Czech Pilsner. Really good! I was shocked to find out it's imported from Germany - smells amazing and tastes even better, served in chilled glass.

They also have vodka, whiskey and other hard alcohol, if you like.
Also buffalo meat, chicken - finally, life is full of flavors again!

After being ovo-fish-veg diet in Rishikesh, where things were pretty bland, I need to pace myself. That said, I definitely don't miss hard alcohol.

The vegetarian noodle soup Thukpa smells divine - garlic, red/spring onion, carrot, cabbage thinly sliced, yumm, and either butter or ghee.

Too bad I'm only here for one day, and on the first day, my stomach isn't ready for the meat Thukpa, which seems to be very popular here.

It's quite spicy though - red chili! Also serve condiments: pickled green chilies and a red chili paste - definitely skipping those.

The noodles themselves are nothing special most probably made of wheat, but the broth is amazing. I can only imagine how delicious the meat broth must be!

Definitely worth of try."
5,Excellent momos in a 'no nonsense' kind of set up!

5,"After a lot of research for the best momos in Kathmandu, we settled for this hidden gem. Loved the vegetable chow mein!! The momos were also some of the best we've had in Nepal. Great location too!"
5,"This restaurant's owner originally opened at Bhagawati Bahal at Thamel 2 decades ago the name of the restaurant was different that time. And they moved to Saat Dobato and again moved to Kaal Dhara. I am one of the happy customer. It's been 2 decades or more I often go there to have momo (dumplings) and Buff Chillies. These are my favourite dish. And the taste is as good as it is used to be before 20 years. I recommend five star for the food and five star for the price and five star for the volume of the food also. It is cheap and delicious. But some staff needs smile on their faces and if you guys have parking services it will be great.

Only the problem is its closed on Saturday. Never seen a restaurant that is closed on Saturdays."

4,Good authentic food
5,"If you're in Kathmandu and you haven't tried the chili momos at Yangling Tibetan Restaurant, what are you even doing with your life? These bad boys are spicy--and I mean spicy--but in the best possible way. As someone who enjoys a good kick in the mouth, these chili momos quickly became my favorite dish during my stay. Seriously, if you like your food to bring a little (or a lot) of heat, you'll be in heaven. And the best part? They won't break the bank. The prices here are ridiculously low for the quality and flavor you get.

But it's not just the food that makes this place special. The people here are super friendly and welcoming, always ready to share a smile or have a chat. It's the kind of place where you feel like a regular, even if it's your first time. I ended up eating here multiple times during my stay in Kathmandu (who can resist those momos?), and every visit felt like a mini celebration of food, flavor, and hospitality.

So, if you're craving something flavorful, spicy, and affordable, Yangling is the place to be. Just remember: don't underestimate the chili--but hey, if you can handle the heat, you'll be rewarded with one of the best food experiences in Kathmandu."
5,Clean and authentic
5,"Incredibly tasty food at low prices! Their veg chili momos are zesty and flavorful, and their veg chow mein tastes wonderful with the chutney! I think this might be my favorite place in Kathmandu."
5,"The best momos we had during our stay in Nepal! The staff is extremely nice, and the food couldn't be more delicious! Highly recommend. We ate here several times!"
5,You better believe I came to this restaurant twice during my stay for that killer Thenthuk. I was shook with how flavourful that broth was. Chicken chilli Momos were also a HIT!

5,Best thukpa and momo in Kathmandu !!
4,"Yangling is the place in KTM for great Momos, and amazing Thukpas / Thenthuk. My personal recommendation are the steam buff momos, and the fried chicken momos. For Thenthuk, I would go for the mixed, with nice chicken, egg, veggies, and tasty noodles. Particularly amazing is the broth, which tastes rich in flavor, and has a nice texture. Service is really friendly, prices fair, and the vibe in the place in the first or second floor is amazing!"

5,"A regular to this restaurant. They have the whole building to themselves.
Must haves here are Buff momos, pork chilly and buff chilly.
One set back is that there is no parking. However,  bikes can be parked down on your own risks."
5,Very good pork momos and thenduk. Enough seats and good service. Freshly made pork momos are big and juicy.
5,Delicious authentic Tibetan food! We got two different types of momo and Thentuk to share. Just a little bit spicy with lots of flavor. Definitely some of the best momo we've had! Couple beer options but no other cocktails. Cheap prices too!
5,"Best comfort food in Thamel  major love for their Thentuk, silky smooth noodle, warm soup with generous toppings and portion, i can't help but keep on coming back for it, ate here 3-4 times during my 5days in Kathmandu, and still can't get enough of it"
5,"This spot serves up tasty, filling Tibetan food for super reasonable prices. The thukpa was my favorite I had in Nepal, and the chili momo and kothey momo shouldn't be missed either!"

5,The best momos in Thamel
5,"Incredible food here, I had the egg thentuk which was simple and nutritious, and the chilli veggie momo was the absolute highlight.

Smiley staff and great experience too, would recommend"
5,Simple clean comfortable decor and consistently delicious food upstairs on a couple of small floor space levels.
4,"After reading good reviews on Google Map, my 3 teenage daughters and I went here for dinner.  The food and service were good but not something to be excited about.  The chili Momo (which are not available elsewhere) was very good however.  This place is at the far end of Thamel on a rather dark street (unlike the busy area of Thamel which are brightly lit).  All in all, we had a good meal."
5,best place!
5,"Came here several times for the veg thenthuk, so warming and with lots of flavour!"
5,Delightfully wonderful momos.
5,The portions are generous and the flavor is mild. It has no strong flavor and is easy to eat.

5,Stayed in Kathmandu for 5 days and ate here 3 times! The food is delicious and fresh. Has a simple menu and is great for vegetarians. Had the steamed and fried vegetable momos and the vegetable thukpa. Very reasonably priced! Can't recommend this place enough to anyone visiting Kathmandu!
5,"Authentic Tibetan food served in a simple setting, nothing fancy but the food - that is fancy. I had chicken Thukpa, it was tasty and wholesome, my friend had the same. Reasonably priced, helpful staff, shared tables to maximise on space and popularity. Not a spot to hang around in, make space for the next person.
Just go."

Literally waited 2 hours for our orders to arrive. At the last moment came to know that they were just hoing out to buy ingredients.
They are offering pathetic service being in a prime location. We left the place after waiting 2 hours  full of disappointment.
Not recommended at all."

1,"The restaurant is too expensive compared to other nearby restaurant in Thamel, also with hidden charges (10% service + 13% VAT) plus from the menu rate. Food was only normal and not very tasty (we had thakkali) and the staff served the food and didn't bother to check if anything else required.

Even though he took service charge and tax, didn't provide the receipt.

Ambiance and cleanliness was fine. Don't try this unless you have too much money to spend. I would recommend try another as lot of restaurant in Thamel."
5,Very nice restaurant with Sincere staff It is out of the busy streets and serves  local and foreign food. The waiter that served us was  well  informed about all the dishes.

4,"very slow service, it took almost 40min to bring us chicken sizzler and egg chop suey. sizzler was with good portion and taste, veggies were bit raw and they gave us extra sauce. they priced us extra for egg omelette for veg chop suey. overall food was decent, mist improve waiting service time then would visit again."
5,Have been visiting this place for half a year it's great service is best and elegant atmosphere loved it
3,"Located on 5th floor of United Trade Center at Tripura Marg, Kathmandu, De-Valley Restaurant offers dining experience with a spectacular view. From the outdoor patio, guests can enjoy a scenic overlook of the bustling streets and the iconic Dashrath Rangashala Stadium.

It's an ideal spot for meetings and get-togethers, thanks to its ample seating arrangements.

One of the practical aspects of dining here is the availability of underground paid parking. For added convenience, guests can request a discount on parking fees by speaking in the reception."
5,Every thing is excellent

They also have a playing area for kids. Had been there before a couple of times and this place never dissapoints. The view from this place is also amazing. You can see the busy streets of Tripureshwor as well as the Dasarath stadium. Thumbs up for this place. Do visit and enjoy!!

The service deserves a special mention--especially Rahul, who was serving us. He went above and beyond to make sure our experience was nothing short of the best. His attentiveness, friendliness, and genuine care really stood out and made the whole evening memorable.

It wasn't just about the delicious food, but the warmth and service that made this visit exceptional. I'll definitely be coming back and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great dining experience."

Borshch is a UKRAINIAN national dish!
It's the same as saying that ""Dal"" is an Indian dish!
Your manager was informed that this is written incorrectly, but you didn't change this name in your menu!
Due to the fact that you don't want to acknowledge that borshch is a Ukrainian national dish and that it should be correctly written as Ukrainian Borshch, and that it tastes awful, I'm giving it one star.
Hire a Ukrainian woman, let her teach you how to cook real UKRAINIAN borshch ;)

The staff did seem a touch unsure about some items on the menu at times (drinks particularly) but were friendly nevertheless."
1,"There is no ""Russian Borscht"". Borscht can be only Ukrainian. If you don't see difference between russians and Ukrainians, then all can't see difference between Nepal and India."
5,We went for my birthday dinner to Chimney last year. The vibe is just so immaculate there! and the food obviously was so yum that I've still not gotten over it! The staff there gave us a complimentary brownie and sang me birthday song. It's abt to be a year and i was thinking abt how special they made it last year. Thanks to the team <3
5,"Finally, a meal worthy of more than 4 stars in Kathmandu. I have been to so many restaurants in Thamel with a 4.0 or better Google rating, but none of them deserve it. The Chimney deserves it. Lovely hotel, restaurant, food and service. Thank you! You get what you pay for, as they say "
1,"This was the worst place I ever visited .. terrible  food to begin with , they didn't inform about the high chairs despite of early reservation , they didn't have many dishes that were in the menu .. tapas were very average and the main  course was the worst .. a road side simple cafe has better food choices and for the price they charge it is not ""acceptable "" . I rate it -100"
5,Best
5,This is amazing . Their design is  so beautiful . This place is also beautiful .
5,"Cozy and tasty food with friendly staff,
Best restaurant inside of Yak and Yeti Hotel, Kathmandu's"
5,Ok guzel servis harika atmosfer ve lezzetli yemekler tesekkurler . Katmandu'ya tekrar gelirsem kesinlikle  tekrar giderim
5,We vivisted as a big group and ordered many dishes and everytbing was good quality and we had Xabi as our waiter who was friendly and nice
5,"During my visit to The Chimney Restaurant, nestled within the historic Lal Durbar palace at Hotel Yak & Yeti, I was thoroughly impressed by the blend of traditional and contemporary ambiance. The setting, adorned with a sixty-year-old copper chimney, creates a unique and charming atmosphere that complements the exquisite dining experience.

The food was amazing, with each dish showcasing a perfect balance of Asian and Western influences, leaving a lasting impression on my palate.

The service was impeccable, with Saurab, Abiral, Rabi, and Dipesh ensuring that every detail was attended to with care. Their warm hospitality made the evening all the more enjoyable.

The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the Baked Alaska, which was nothing short of fantastic--perfectly executed and a delight to the senses. Overall, The Chimney Restaurant is a must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable fine-dining experience in Kathmandu."
5,"This restaurant offers a truly exceptional dining experience. The food is top-notch, the service is impeccable (shoutout to Kamal, Sonika, Ashim, and Srijana!), and the atmosphere is simply wonderful. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a memorable meal in Kathmandu!"
5,"One of the best fine dine experience in the country. Mr.Abiral Thapa was exceptional with the drinks preparation and allowed us with the best drinks experience. Also the continental delicacies were absolutely perfect from Mr.Rabindra, the cuisines were the best of the kind. Mr.Saurab provided us with the best service. Also Mr.Lhakpa helped us with the menu, and food selection. We have been in a few of the restaurant in Nepal and abroad but the hospitality from the YNY and the Chimney team is truly one of a Kind. I would recommend anyperson of the world to chose YNK team for the best hospitality experience in Nepal."
5,"Very beautiful restaurant serving very tasty and beautiful dishes. The chef rajendra prepared the plates wonderfully and mahesh is a very pleasant waiter. If I had one more day in Kathmandu, I would return here without a doubt."
5,"Really loved this fine dining experience. The menu was so good we had great difficulty deciding what to order. All dishes and drinks were exquisite!
Service by Rabi was also excellent!
All in all great place to celebrate a special event or even just a nice night out.
Small note to the kitchen: the complementary bread was great but the focaccia was very dry
All in all very happy und we will be back!"
5,"Loved the ambience & the vibe. The food  was truly exquisite, and the complimentary dishes were also quite delectable. The hospitality was exceptional, and the service was truly outstanding. A special acknowledgment to Mr. Rabi Sharma for providing such excellent service."
5,"The Chimney Restaurant
Chimney Restaurant:
It's expensive, the portions are fashionably small, and the food isn't the best I've ever had. HOWEVER, I still give it 5 Stars  for the gorgeous setting, the wonderful service, the overall luxurious experience. (And there's a gorgeous ballroom-style room right next to the restaurant.)"
5,Top 3 of restaurants worldwide !
5,Food is so good. Finger licking good. Definitely visiting again for lamb chop. A bit expensive but worth it for the ambience and amazing experience. I only gave service 4 star because i didnt like the way the staff were constantly coming to ask again and again if we needed anything.
5,Lovely food and great service by Saurab.
5,Great quality western food. Amazing service.
5,"Wonderful place to visit,  nice food and great service "
5,Top notch service! Pork belly was fantastic
5,"As you walk through the entrance you're greeted and guided to your table at the Chimney Restaurant. At the heart of the Chimney Restaurant is a hardworking, skilled and passionate team of chefs catering for not only the restaurant, but the whole of the complex and historical features. Rajiv has done an exceptional job of maintaining standards throughout the whole of his team alongside Sanil and Dioendra, as well as others. They clearly know what they're doing, the food was outstanding and the service team carried the passion through to the table. We had the pleasure of Saurab as our waiter as well as the help of Joseff. We experienced of multiple local Nepali dishes, vegetarian dishes and beautiful wine. Portion sizes are generous. We left very happy feeling like we walked away with an experience and intised to come again, not only for food but for a stay also.
You can also see that all the staff here enjoy providing a high end service which makes for the experience.

Thank you very much to the Chimney chef team - Shane and Freya, see you soon."
1,Though the food was nice but it has VERY bad service and restaurant make shady deals with local tour guide . Not recommended for large group!
1,There was an agreement that was detrimental to the customer between the hotel and the local guide. The hotel is very uncommunicative and very unfriendly to tourists. disappointing for a hotel on this class
1,"Food was good, but very not recommended for big group lunch/dinner, suspicious billing experience"
1,5 star hotel but 1 star service lol. Food was good but doesnt justify the experience we had 
5,"Delicious food in rustic and authentic surroundings. The gentle crackling of the fire and comforting smell of smoke makes for a serene and beautiful setting for dining. The food is remarkably good, with care put into every dish. I had the prawn tempura and catfish main, both of which were surprisingly tasty despite Nepal not being known for seafood. Service is attentive yet able to give you your space at the same time."
5,"Great portions, considering it's fine dining,
Loved the atmosphere, the Staff and the Service"
5,"Amazing place, great food and superb staff "
5,"The Chimney Restaurant is one of the oldest and most popular restaurants in Kathmandu, Nepal. It was founded in 1968 by Boris Lissanevitch, a Russian emigre who wanted to introduce Nepal to the world of fine dining. The restaurant is located in the heart of Kathmandu, in a historic building that was once part of the royal palace.

We started our dining experience with Amuse-bouche, Focaccia bread with olive and salsa dips. Super!

Items we had,
- Russian Borscht 800NPR
- Asian Tomato Salad 600NPR
- Arugula Feta Salad 700NPR
- Tom Yum Soup
- Prawn Tempura w/ Ponzu dumpling sauce 1300NPR
- Chili Caramel Salmon 2500NPR
- Lamb Chops 4500NPR
- Baked Alaska Sagarmatha 700NPR

We had a wonderful dining experience here, perfect for celebrating special occasions. Starting with the salads, both of them were fresh and our favourite pick would be the arugula feta salad, it was a little sweet and refreshing. We loved the Russian borscht made of veggies. The lamb chops and the grilled salmon were the stars of the show! Worth a visit here! The prawn was crispy and perfectly flavoured. A trio of frozen ice cream wrapped in meringue made the baked Alaska delicious! Also, the serving with fire was something unique for us!

The service here is top-notch. They are always happy to make recommendations and help you choose the perfect meal.

The atmosphere at The Chimney Restaurant is elegant and inviting. The restaurant is decorated with traditional Nepali furniture and artwork. The dining room is spacious and well-lit, and there is a large outdoor patio where you can enjoy your meal on a warm evening.

 Open from 12-10.30 pm

The restaurant is beautiful and very nicely decorated
The staff was simply amazing and helpful. Our only concern was that our drinks were a bit delayed.
Food was good and the portions are very satisfying.
We had the pork boas, the pork belly and the pulled pork tacos."
5,"Great experience for a reasonable price.  The staff are amazing.  A special note of thanks to Kamal, Numa, and Ajay for their exceptional courteous service and attention to detail.  I highly recommend this establishment!"
4,Overall I liked it. Pl!asure for Indian food lovers.
5,Good Experience
5,"Cute place, live performances so it's unique. Staff is friendly and accommodating!!"
3,"A beautiful setting to hang out, but the Newari food itself was only mediocre."
4,Excellent
5,Great experience.. both food and the cultural showcase.
1,"The waiters are well-behaved but are very confused. The food is not tasty and lesser priced restaurants serve better tasty Nepali food in 500 bucks, in other words, it's overpriced. The dancers are good in looks but lack of dance skills and energy. The songs for every dance performance stops abruptly in the middle and the dancers get confused in the middle of the stage and get out of the stage."
5,Nice plane to Refreshment
5,Amazing evening. Lots of local cultural performances was the highlight of the evening. Food was fine but the entire experience is what makes the place special. We dined and we danced. Great evening.
3,"services need to be made effective, abd faster."
5,Nice hospitality service
3,"Don't visit during dinner as there's no ala carte, and the set dinner costs 2595. My friends had veg set and I think it was slightly better.. but only if you are willing to pay the same price for veg only. I think the food is overpriced as there was entertainment on stage."
5,Excellent expensive enjoyed the evening.
3,Delicious Foods
5,Good experience for marriage program. Good food and ambience.
5,Good place for events like marriage party and other events
5,A wonderful and traditional Nepalese dinner restaurant with cultural performances. The food tested great.
5,Very good
5,I had dinner with my family in Nepali Chulo. The food was so good and tasty as well as the staff were nice and friendly.
2,Food was not good as expected..service was good ..
4,Staff friendly and food good. Nice show. Nepalese food excellent. Set menu.
3,Not value for money
3,"We were looking for some authentic Nepali fare after a day of walking around Kathmandu Durbar. This place is one of the first few recommendations that came up on Google.
1. The restaurant was dead empty when we arrived and stayed that way throughout our
meal.
2. They only had set menus available. So it doesn't cater to a person like me who has a small appetite.
3. We ordered for a Non-veg set menu and everything on it was dry. The meat was also chewy. You'll see it in the pictures how my partner literally left so much meat on his plate 'cause it was so unappetizing.
4. We requested their staff for some curry/sauce to go with the meat as an exception but it was denied.
5. The food overall was really average for its price.
6. The dance performances were nice and it was comfortable to have heaters in the dining area.
The servers were really courteous and polite. Overall, we didn't really enjoy our experience much and would not recommend the place to anyone."
1,"I recently visited Nepali Chulo Restaurant and was extremely disappointed with the experience. The food quality was far below expectations, lacking both freshness and authentic taste. Despite the poor quality, the prices were unreasonably high, making the meal feel entirely unjustified. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking good food or value for money."
5,Nice place.
5,Very nice
2,"Place is for foreigners to visit. Cultural dance shows included. The utensils were made up of brass.
Only Fixed menu options sadly veg and non veg set and quite expensive!!!
Lots of parking space.
Food was mediocre for a local person. Service was slow. Staffs were polite. Would not recommend for a local person."
4,An authentic Nepali restaurant serving newari cuisine. Ample parking and it is in a old palace. You find artefacts of yester years adorning the walls of the restaurant. Cultural programs showcasing the Nepali culture during the dine in adds to the ambience. Tasted the cuisine for the first time and it was a decent experience.
5,"Authentic Nepali food, drink and atmosphere."
5,"Ample parking.
Authentic nepali thali is served. Food  was good with taste and quality. Staffs are friendly. Cultural dance from different places of Nepal is very entertaining."
5,"High end authentic Nepali food, super delicious and reminded me of home! Wonderful ambience with folk dance show!"
2,"I've spend 2595 rupees for my dinner. There is no option, a lot of people walking around and starting at you (even though politely asking how was the dish etc), no choice at all regarding the dishes. Only tourist spot, nothing authentic in it. Although the food was good, but the price isn't correct for the experience you're getting. And I agree with someone mentioned in their reviews that you get that feeling of prison. And slow service obviously."
5,A fantastic place to experience Nepali Newari food with glimpses of Nepali culture.
5,"Very good, quality service"
5,Very nice
4,Good one
4,"2500 per person....
Slow service.
Have to improve crew members 

Authentic food restaurants offer delicious dishes that transport diners to far-off lands, embracing diverse cultures on every plate."
4,"nice, well decorated house with authentic
dance performance."
1,The worst experience ever. Would give 0 if I could.. It's like you are in jail.. No option to choose.. limited less option can't even choose varieties of snacks... Would never come back or recommend to anyone....
5,"Nice place in Lazimpat,Kathmandu. Must visit with friends and families. Good food and friendly staffs ."
5,Had a wonderful evening with a friend and family. We enjoyed the evening thoughly.

1,Worst place  tooo slow too slow tooooooooo slow
3,"Lovely ambiance, though the food was a bit disappointing."
5,The place is a vibe with a cozy sitting places and the service is very nice. Sagar dai was very helpful .
5,"This cafe is such a cozy spot with a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The space feels bright and comfortable, with just the right mix of modern touches and homely charm--it's the kind of place where you instantly want to settle in for a while.

The food is excellent. Everything tastes like it's made with care.

A lovely place to relax, enjoy good food, and soak in the calm vibe."

4,"Food and service was good. But don't go here if you're expecting the full rainbow of Indian spices, they've toned it down to address diverse customers from the west."
5,"Siamo stati a pranzo e abbiamo preso dei piatti tipici indiani: tutto molto buono, anche la mousse al cioccolato presa come dessert. Prezzi un po' piu alti della media ma ne vale la pena!"
5,"""Third Eye Restaurant Thamel mein Indian food ke liye best place hai. Food bilkul authentic aur rich taste ke saath serve hota hai. Chicken curry aur naan bohot hi soft aur tasty the.
Atmosphere bhi calm aur comfortable tha. Jo log thoda fine dining experience chahte hain, unke liye perfect jagah hai."""
5,Excellent food just love it
5,"Located in a quiet garden in the busy area of Thamel. Delicious food, culminating with home made coconut ice-cream"
5,Tried the Hydrabadi kebab and Third Eye Special Raan. Had authentic flavors and great portion sizes. Highly recommend this Indian restaurant in Thamel for anyone craving proper Indian food.
5,Very Nice place to eat!!! Very good food!! The service was perfect. Service perfect with dependra!!!
5,"Loved the whole vibe here. It's got this calming, earthy aesthetic with beautiful warm lighting. We went for dinner and the place felt peaceful, not too loud. Food was fantastic, the third eye thaali set and desserts were top-notch. One of the best Indian restaurants in Kathmandu for sure."
5,The best Indian restaurant in Kathmandu.
5,"Honestly, I didn't expect the vibe to be this good. Third eye restaurant in Thamel also have a super cozy, low seating area with beautiful traditional decor! Such a nice break from the usual load restaurants in Thamel. The food and service was outstanding. Will definitely come back."
4,"Best quality Indian food in town. Pricey, yes. But it was worth it. Loved all their Kebabs and curries were point on.
Just one suggestion to the Mgt/Kitchen team, please keep an eye on consistency. One of the Kebabs we ordered & absolutely loved the flavor & texture was Mutton boti kebab. We therefore ordered a second round of the same but sadly the texture was more chewy and not tasty as the earlier one. Please be consistent in what you do "
5,"Visited 2 times in 2 days.
Tried more than 12 dishes with friends, all of them were GREAT. Just Great!
Make sure to visit."
1,very bad service and bad food quality
1,Service is lousy. These people just don't not care to serve. Not even water is served only until asked for
5,"Definitely a good address for Indian food in this area..
Pleasant place (in particular the outside terrace upstair) , good service and good food.
And a good Margarita to start....."
5,Saroj Ghale served us today. He did a amazing job
5,Best place in Thamel for Dining experience quality absolutely guaranteed mouthwatering food must visit in Thamel
5,"Had an amazing fine dining experience in Nepal at Third Eye. The place is clean, cozy, and perfect for a family dinner. Their vegetarian options like paneer tikka masala and dal makhani were outstanding!"
5,"Sharoj ghale fue nuestro camarero y tuvo un trato estupendo. La comida un 10, es deliciosa, tipica de la india pero tambien cuenta con platos occidentales. La carne y el pescado una delicia. El ambiente, tranquilo y acogedor para desconectar un rato del caos con encanto de Katmandu. Gracias!"
5,"The best Indian food you could get in town. Undoubtedly. Great flavour, ambience and taste. Excellent service too. Staffs are very polite pleasant and friendly."
5,"Awesomeness to the peak! Good food, Good ambience, and good service."
5,"Oh my god, the food! Its absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend the restaurant to locals and tourists. I have become a regular here."
5,"This place is incredible! Amazing food (seriously, I've never had naan like that), lovely atmosphere and 5-star service. And it all costs next to nothing. I honestly think I might spend all of my Kathmandu evenings in the same place."
5,Great food and service Dipendra was a legend.
5,"Best restaurant for Indian cuisine!!
Amazing Hospitality and Classy Vibe !!"
5,"The atmosphere of this place was outstanding. Similarly, the food was also highly delectable and the staff were really accomdating and friendly. Do check thid place out if you are around the area."
2,"Felt like having indian food on that day. Google showed it as the top 3 search results near to our location that's around 1 km we were.
Cutting long story short, the place was ok. The food was average, and believe me, for that price  range and ambiance, Kathmanduhave way better places to go.
Overall, it's not worth a shot. As, I'm not a fan of places where the F&B Team doesn't work together(shared by staff)."
5,"Thamel has rarely such cozy place than Third Eye.
5/5 recommende."
5,Ottimo ristorante per avere un'ottima esperienza col cibo nepalese. Locale bello e attenzione molto cordiale. I piatti tipici davvero buonissimi.
5,Amazing food and service. Have come 3 times to this restaurant and have been impressed every time with the service I have recieved. The staff are friendly and very helpful.
5,June 7 2025....i had lunch here and food was very tasty and great ambience....
3,"The prices are on the higher side, we tried the butter naan and butter chicken. The butter chicken was a bit on the sweeter side--might not be for everyone, but still flavorful. The place was clean, and the hygiene standards were impressive. Staff were very cooperative, which added to the overall experience."
5,Food was great and Puzan was great help
4,Terrific service and I especially appreciated   Mr. Saroj Ghale's kindness and attentiveness!
5,Absolutely incredible quality Indian food and just as amazing value for money. Went twice during our visit to Khatmandu and dined in the courtyard- the best location to dine is the upstairs roof terrace. Make sure it's on your list of places to dine when you visit.
5,Great food and excellent service!
5,"Very nice fusion Indian food and the waiter is super nice!
I highly recommend it."
5,"Dipendra delivered some state of the art service. He advised us the best dishes, and each one of them was perfect. Thank you very much, we'll be back next year!"

5,"The food is amazing! And the wait staff was friendly and helpful both times we visited. A special shout-out to  Aswin and Dipendra who waited on us and helped make we had everything we needed. The facility was clean, beautiful and enchanting. We ate here 4 times during our time in kathmandu!"
4,Frankly i would have given more ratings. But it was expensive. It is indian food and very good  ( not south indian ) . People from all walks of life come there. Had lunch and dinner multiple times. Don't have pics will take next time
5,The food is great and the service is even better! I had dinner here three times while in kathmandu.
1,Food was too pricey and tasteless.
5,Nice food and ambiance. Enjoyed the service and food.
5,"Visited Third Eye Last night and my god the food was bomb!
An amalgamation of exotic Indian flavors, just the right amount of everything!
Would definitely recommend!"
4,Nice curry and atmosphere
5,"Apres 17 voyages au Nepal, nous pouvons dire que Third Eye Restaurant est la meilleure adresse du pays. Le service est irreprochable, un accueil chaleureux et des plats vraiment succulents. Chaque fois, c'est un immense plaisir de venir deguster les specialites Nepalaises. Vous etes parfaits, ne changez rien..."

5,"Doskonale indyjskie jedzenie.  Palak paneer, paneer masala. Doskonala obsluga. Niezly klimat w centrum Thamel."
2,"Food was not good. The palak paneer totally lacked flavour and was watery. The ""tender"" lamb kebab was not tender. The ambience was lovely and service attentive but when you're spending double on food, it's definitely not worth it."
1,"Nourriture excellente mais je DECONSEILLE FORTEMENT, jour meme : nausees et vomissements, apres 3 semaine de galeres (douleurs intestinales et diahree a chaque repas) j'apprends que c'est du a des parasites alimentaires. Nous avions ete 3 a manger la bas et nous etions tous dans le meme cas. A fuir, l'image d'un ""bon restau"" ne fait pas tout !"
1,"I am sure this is good Indian food for people who have never eaten Indian food. I ordered the safest Indian dish ""chicken tikka masala"" and it was completely tasteless. Same goes for multiple kebabs we ordered. I cannot express my disappointment in words on how huge a letdown it was.

A roadside shop I ate at served me better naans and chicken dish for 1/4th the price. Keep your expectations very low in terms of food and be prepared to wash your hands multiple times to get rid of colors after eating here."
5,Lovely atmosphere and great food.
3,"We hardly ever bad review anyone but 10% service charge is optional and not mandatory in Nepal, so this experience must be shared.

Would have given all 5 stars if not for the experience we had tonight.

We have visited Kathmandu numerous times and Third Eye Restaurant has always been our favorite place to eat.  In fact, this is our second time dining here this week, and we had a great meal with great service, that is, until the bill came.

When the server presented the bill that totaled at 8500 NPR, (food and drinks 7500 NPR plus 13% VAT), he ""politely"" said that even though the bill showed 8500 rupees, it should actually be 9000 something, as the 10% service charge was not on the bill.  He even got the nerve to show us a copy of the photo menu which has a small line written on the bottom about 10% service charge being mandatory.

When we told him that we have never been asked for a mandatory service charge in any of our visits to Third Eye Restaurant, nor the Roadhouse just across the street, nor any restaurants here in Nepal, and that we have eaten here just a few days ago and has added over 10% tips without being asked, he quickly backed off and said he was sorry and the service charge has been removed.

We have always believed that servers who did a good job should be rewarded, but trying to scam unwary customers by trying to add a so-called mandatory service charge is totally unacceptable and a disgrace to such a great restaurant.

It takes years to build a reputation but dishonesty ruined everything."
5,Tried Third Eye Restaurant and had a great experience. The chicken biryani was flavorful and well-cooked. Also tried roti and curry--both were equally good. Service was nice and courteous. Would recommend.
5,Excellent Indian meal. This place is up there with the best Indian meal I have had anywhere. Every dish we had was superb
1,"The food was good, but when the vat is closed, you can add vat as per your wish.
Very very disappointed  i will never visit this restaurant..again"
5,"Third Eye Restaurant is a true culinary delight! With rich Indian flavors and beautifully presented dishes, every bite feels special. The warm service and cozy setting make it a perfect spot for both casual meals and special occasions. Highly recommended!"

Review: Excellent Service Experience

I recently had the pleasure of experiencing outstanding service, and I couldn't be more satisfied. From the moment I arrived, the staff was warm, welcoming, and highly professional. They went above and beyond to ensure all my needs were met promptly and with a smile.

What stood out most was their attention to detail and willingness to assist with any request, no matter how small. It's rare to find such genuine hospitality these days, and it truly made my visit memorable.

Highly recommend to anyone looking for top-notch service and a pleasant experience. I'll definitely be coming back!

Thank you Mr Pathak for accompanying us"

5,"I had an incredible dining experience at Hokkaido House, and a huge part of that was thanks to Sashi's outstanding service. She was warm, attentive, and genuinely made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in. Sashi managed our table with such grace--always checking in at the right moments, giving great recommendations, and ensuring everything was perfect throughout our meal.

The food was equally exceptional. Every dish we tried was fresh, beautifully presented, and full of flavor--from the sushi to the hot dishes. You can tell there's real care and skill behind the kitchen.

Sashi and the team at Hokkaido House truly delivered a top-notch experience. Highly recommend both the service and the food--you won't be disappointed!"

1,"Formal Complaint Regarding Catering Services of rox bar garden

am writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the catering services provided at my relative sister's recent wedding, where I was invited, in role of ( DJ ) for the event.  I unfortunately experienced a significant lack of consideration in terms of servicing meals or snacks to dj . I could see intentionally ignoring to service food for dj (me) whole event.

As you are aware, being a DJ requires continuous focus to entertain , stay in same place till program end and energy to ensure the success of the celebration. However, throughout the duration of the wedding, I was not provided with any meals or refreshments. Despite my best efforts to maintain my energy levels, the absence of sustenance greatly impacted my ability to perform optimally.

I completed my duty around 9pm because thats the time hotel staff had informed me to end it. After that I approached the kitchen area /dinner place where food is, in hopes of finally being able to enjoy a meal. To my dismay, right infront door, manager guy i guess, said that there is no food available . (Also with no alternative solutions presented ..)   i left embarrassed and went back garden to pack my stuff .   At-least should have informed food is about to close before it closing time. so that nobody left out empty stomach in wedding.

20min later - same manager guy came and said - ( khana  ubreko cha khaney vaye khanu vannalai  aako ) the way in such word .. Only if (ubreko vayera) , he came to tell me while was still packing my setup. I said i am sorry vayo hos vaney.

This experience was not only disheartening but DISREGARDED and UNDERVALUED.

I understand that organising food  services wedding is a complex task, and oversights can occur.     However, the lack of provision for essential sustenance during such an event, is unacceptable.  I believe to prioritise the well-being of all individuals involved in event.

I kindly request that you address this matter serious and take necessary steps to ensure that similar incidents are avoided in the future. Providing meals for all  including DJs, should be a fundamental aspect of event planning.

if there's rule of hotel to not provide food to dj then kindly informed dj while entertaining event, so that we will be prepared to not to starve in event and this thing would never happen .

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt response and resolution.
and apology for long message.

Sincerely,
[DJ. Joslyn rai]"
5,"It's so delicious food,
The best food experience I have in Nepal!"
4,A great finer dining experience. The service was excellent and the food was great.
5,They were specializing in Italian this week.  So good!!  Laxman was a really exceptional server.
5,"Great pizza, delicious bruschetta, wonderful service."
3,"Food at the Italian restaurant was mediocre, service was lousy and it took multiple attempts to get attention of waiters, food was basically not the way we asked it, if we say no garlic it means no garlic...."
5,"This fine dining Italian restaurant is really a class. If you are looking for some delicious Italian cuisine, this is a must visit. I went there twice and the chef ( Abhishek) made sure he served us the best veggie pizza- primavera! Last time I also had white sauce pasta and asparagus soup, which to my surprise was amazing. Pricing is premium and so is the food. They were thoughtful to make my occasion special by a small celebration token."
5,Amaging view and great food and great service  and thank you so much chef dhiraj you make my breakfast amazing and thanks for all kitchen team and service
5,"We went there for a birthday celebration with my family. We had an amazing time. Due to the COVID hotel itself was not fully opened and many renovation works were going on but you could still enjoy the architectural masterpiece located within the huge area. The restaurant itself was what you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Staffs were friendly and professional, food was delicious, a huge selection of beverages, and a beautiful environment to enjoy your dinner. You could see that the management took the sanitation pretty seriously to keep it safe and hygienic. I loved how you could see the chefs preparing food in the open kitchen. Moreover, the management team surprised us with a complimentary birthday cake, really appreciate that. We got lucky as well to get a 20% discount which was ongoing for a month on the occasion of the hotel's 20th anniversary.

I would recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a quick gateway to spend quality time with friends and family."
5,One of the best truly 7 star city resort hotel not only in Nepal but well qualified to be so in south Asia as well.
4,Loved their buffet. Its really amazing with wide and delicious selection. I loved everything about it. Worth it.
5,Always good
5,Very recommend. Different types of cuisines.  Tasty. 
5,Good food and environment
3,hotele issneun sigdang
5,Excellent experience ... Even though our order was not quite right the first time the chef personally came out and corrected the situation quickly.
4,Decent pizza. Great ambiance.

3,liked this restaurant

5,good
5,A great experience. I recommend if you are looking for a tasting menu experience in Kathmandu. It's nothing but an experience from the initial hand washing and taking your shoes off when you arrive. To the table and apron they put on you. We did the 6 course meal and it was perfect. Lovely time and I would go back again.
5,"Beautiful setting, excellent service. The 6 - 22 course options are a great idea. I did 9 and was stuffed.  It's priced for tourists but worth it"
5,"A lovely place and certainly not to be missed if you want an authentic Nepali culinary experience. We ordered a 6-course meal and it was sumptuous, filling and exotic. Our hostess, Yuma, would explain every course to us and her team of servers served us with love and care. We were a noisy group of 11 with lots of curiosity and questions. We all came out amazed at the entire experience."
5,"We had dinner here in a group of 11 from different part of world.
Me coming from hospitality industry,  cannot believe that a restaurant can give such a quality and service in today's time.
Team of 3 girls serving us were amazing. We were there today 16th of July at 730pm."
4,The restaurant is located inside Hotel Dwarika.
5,"We had an amazing time at this Nepalese restaurant and wanted to thank the entire team for such a memorable evening. It was our first time trying authentic Nepalese cuisine, and we were absolutely blown away by the flavors and variety of the 6 dishes. Every bite was a discovery -- rich in spices, perfectly balanced, and full of heart.
The staff was warm and welcoming, happy to explain the dishes and share a bit about Nepalese food culture. The ambiance added to the experience, with a cozy atmosphere that made us feel like we were on a journey far from home.
Thank you for introducing us to such a beautiful and delicious part of your country."
5,Really good service with delightful servers. We had the 12 course meal which was way too much. Highly recommend this place for the best of Nepalese cuisine.
5,It is a culinary journey of Nepal. A dinner you won't forget.
5,"The restaurant and environment are incredible.
We had a 6 course meal. The experience was amazing, from the service to the food quality. They always explained the dishes and always cared if anything else was necessary.
I highly recommend as an elevated Nepalese traditional experience."
5,"Excellent Nepali Restaurant, typical local dishes and wonderful service. Expensive"
5,Unique dining experience in Kathmandu. Loved the 6 course menu .
3,"The environment and atmosphere are what stand out here. Very well decorated, comfortable seats, wide tables and spacious. The portion sizes are big, unless you're a very big eater, stick to the smaller number of courses.

The food was just okay, certainly not worth the price we paid. It was well presented but the taste didn't match. We had 200 npr momo better than here.

The service from staff is not consistent, we had just one that was good, a lot of them did not provide a description of the food and we had to keep asking for water."
5,"It was my first time visiting Nepal and a friend recommended this place. It's a good place to try different Nepali dishes, although pricey. Wonderful ambiance and good service. I had a great experience dining here."
5,Ottima degustazione! Ho chiesto di avere un menu non piccante e cosi e stato. Cibo ottimo (prima volta per me) e servizio eccellente. Vi consiglio di passare se siete a Kathmandu!
3,Cadre incroyable et la nourriture est bonne mais tres cher pour ce que c'est. Et c'est beaucoup trop! Finir le menu devient un supplice.
4,Average
3,"Stepping into Krishnarpan Restaurant feels like being transported to the heart of Nepal. The staff's warm welcome and the inviting atmosphere immediately sets the tone for an evening of cultural immersion.

The multi-course menu offers a variety of traditional Nepali dishes.  Each course is presented with care, showcasing the culinary diversity of Nepal.

However, while the food is diverse and well-explained, the taste is somewhat average. Some dishes shine, but others may not leave a lasting impression.

One notable downside is the price. The multi-course menu is quite expensive, which may not feel entirely justified given the average taste of the food."
5,"A must visit place in Nepal. Located in Dwarika's hotel, which itself is built in traditional nepalese architecture. Beautiful ambiance, excellent service with Traditionally made & served authentic nepalese cuisine, in a form of 6 course nepalese style fine dining experience. A value for money, and lifetime experience to carry from Nepal."
4,Good place for a good food.

5,"Wow. Just wow. It's an amazing restaurant for tourists or anyone in general, but it's not about the food mostly (even though it's amazing) it's about the sense of adventure while waiting for each course. 11/10!!!"
2,"The place itself is good, but really too expensive for the offer. What you get is a good experience but it's definitely not worth the expense (we paid 95$ per person for 9 dishes each and two glasses of wine). You can eat having the same quality for one tenth of the price in many other restaurants in Kathmandu. It really seems like something thought for tourists."
5,"Royalty treatment, would recommend it to anyone who'd like to experience it.

The cumulative amount of food you'll eat is a lot, I would advise to temper your hunger and not say yes to every refilling of food during the courses."
5,"Very good food. It is a busy place and seems like the staff were working very hard just to take the orders and delivering orders. Felt a bit rushed and understaffed service wise.

Shoes off restaurant. Reserve a proper sit down table in advance if you are unable to sit low. Those get filled up quickly.

We weren't offered a choice of menu, only choice was a 6 course veg or non veg dinner.  If you count every item, there are 20 including tea/coffee. At the beginning of the meal, dinners are to leave something on the small plate as offering to god. Complimentary a very strong local alcohol was offered as well."
5,Love the hospitality with athentic nepali cuisine
3,Good dishes and impeccable service in a beautiful atmosphere. But the price is about 3/4 times what it would be in another restaurant. For this difference of price we would expect also really amazing dishes and it was not the case. So the bill gives a bitter taste in the end.
5,"Wow, this is one of the best places to do a comprehensive tasting of Newari Nepali cuisine. You can opt for 6 courses up to 20 courses (I got the 16). However, it IS a LOT of food and it's basically impossible to finish the meal unless you can eat a lot. The food itself is an incredible display of all the different types of food that is served in Nepal, served in a beautiful traditional setting that's both serene/calming and stunning/decorative. Service is incredibly upscale, polite, and smart. Cost for the tasting can range from $69 (6 course) to $115 (16 course) and up per person."
4,Good place to have dinner here for tourists 
5,Very nice and delicate restaurant to taste local recipes.
5,"Had a great time at our anniversary at his restaurant. Amazing staff, best ambiance and great food.. thanks a lot for making our day special.. "
5,"The food is alright, other local places serves food more tasty and cost friendly but the experience is best. You must expect the good experienve considering the budget. Come for experience and service, not food"
5,All things are amazing 5 star ratings
5,Beautiful restaurant and amazingly curated course.
5,This is amazing. You should not miss while u r in  Nepal. Food starts from around 60$
4,"Had a 12 course meal and the experience was great 
It's great for khaires."
1,"thery need to improve more on service , once the dinner is served they need to ask for additional food instead i need to call for service people every time."
5,"Amazing culinary experience.... Perfectly set restaurant, this place is more of a cultural experience where you can enjoy the nepali cuisines in best possible way it's not just the food but the ambience the set up, the staffs and the way everything is served .....it's a must experience place for anyone into dining experience..... any friends and family travelling from abroad do take their they would be amazed by the experience dwarikas provide to their guests at their Resturant... obviously the quality and service of Dwarikas is a top notch.... the staffs are amazing "
5,One of the best in the town. Super delicious food items. Service is excellent. Nice environnement and great atmosphere. Be mindful of items being delivered for buffet as most of them have multiple items and the quantity becomes a lot. Great place to be in.
5,"This is extreme fine dining and traditional Nepali-Newari restaurant. It is by prior reservation and menu disclosure only! To be specific, it is located inside Dwarika's kathmandu.They have this typical Indian-Nepali tradition of not wasting food and they prepare on by order. It is once in a lifetime experience place, in terms of overwhelming ambience, the service, the six course meal and the extravagant cost! It is a foreigner's paradise! If you are lucky to get a chance to visit, I would highly recommend it!"
3,Sehr schones Ambiente. Menu war allerdings der kulinarische Tiefpunkt unserer 20 jahrigen Gourmet Reise Tradition. Zum Abschluss bekommt man allerdings die mit eigenem Namen versehene Menukarten geschenkt. Wenn das nicht die Anreise rechtfertigt...
2,"Beautiful atmosphere and setting, with attentive service staff ... must've been the head chef's day off... as the food was awful! Sadly no seasoning, and a crying shame ... was zero value for money... As a chef myself,  I would expect chef's to taste, adjust seasoning and correct before serving guests... sadly the chef, I don't think, cooks from the heart ... sadly...lacked flavour, taste, and texture"

3,"Food was not up to expectations, the dips were watery (comment by lebanese native)."
5,"This was not just a restaurant service, it was a whole experience in and of itself. We ordered food and they actually brought a complementary pita pizza for us while we were waiting. The pizza was good, as well as the other dishes that I tried. I will post the name of the dishes once I remember. Great environment, wonderful dining areas, and excellent staff and service."
5,Great view from Tahina Terrace and nice breeze while enjoying a delicious pizza and desert.  Wish we had more time to try some other dishes because the menu looked awesome. Service was quick and we were even given an appetizer to try as a welcome. The chocolate flan with a layer of caramel had great texture and flavor.
4,"Terrific ambience, great spot overlooking the city and mountains in the distance. The service was very friendly and efficient. The menu options are international and nicely presented.

Surprisingly, the food quality was slightly lower than expected. The salmon was a tad underdone, and the shrimp was not served hot. Such a shame!

These issues could be addressed with a little more attention to detail in the kitchen."
5,The rooftop dine in place really serves an amazing food with super friendly employees Aayush & Rabina were best at the service . It was cold and they offered us throw over . It was such an amazing evening out there 
5,"Tahina Terrace is so good we ate there twice during our stay, and the menu is extensive enough that we had no difficulty ordering entirely different spreads each time. Clean and scenic, the staff are welcoming, attentive, and professionals when it comes to making guests feel at home (Sanjeev, Okesh, and Rabina were especially great). Highly recommend!"
5,Highly recommend
5,"Great ambience - restaurant is part of Marriott Kathmandu
Must try if you are fond of Mediterranean food ."
5,Beautiful view of the Kathmandu valley. Had a great meal and cocktail. Sanjeev was a friendly and highly attentive server. Thank-you!
5,"This restaurant served the perfect meal after our arduous trek. The Mediterranean cuisine was a lovely contrast to all the Nepalese food I've had throughout the trip.

The shish kebab, mushroom risotto, and calamari fritti were absolutely delicious. But the star of the night had to be the baba ganoush.

Really lovely meal in a nice restaurant situated in the Marriott Hotel Kathmandu, great views from the rooftop and a good escape from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu's streets!"

4,Absolutely fantastic experience! The food was delicious.

5,Best pizza in Kathmandu
4,"Today's pizza and mint lemonade were delicious, and it's a clean and pleasant place no matter when I/we come. I am especially grateful for the smiles and lovely service from the female staff every time. That being said, I do have one comment. I'm put off by the fact that with every drink and meal, several staff members come up and ask ""How is it?"", ignoring what I'm doing. This attitude is so by-the-manual that I imagine management told them to do it. If that's the case, I'd like to say to the manager, ""You might better to think about what the service is."" I feel that these polite and courteous young people are not doing this excessive customer service by their own ideas."
3,Average
5,Pizza was delicious. Enjoyed!
4,"Been here few times
-With my wife
-Also with my friends
-also with my family

Never disappoints
Love the taste of the food
The ambience is good
The staff service is awesome

Parking is an issue
But there is a pay parking right in front of it which sometimes can be fully packed."
5,"Roadhouse in Jhamsikhel has been a favorite of mine since childhood, and it holds a special place in my heart. The cozy ambiance, amazing food, and welcoming vibe make it a timeless spot. Their pizzas are especially delicious, and the menu offers great variety. Whether it's for a casual meal or a special gathering, Roadhouse always delivers. Highly recommend for anyone looking for good food and a nostalgic, comforting experience!"
5,One of the best pizza in town
4,"Roadhouse Cafe is a top-notch dining spot known for its exceptional ambience and delicious menu. The indoor seating is beautifully designed, offering a cozy and inviting atmosphere that's perfect for any occasion. Whether you're catching up with friends or enjoying a family meal, the setting enhances the overall dining experience.

The highlight of the menu is undoubtedly their pizzas, which are baked to perfection in a traditional oven. With a variety of options to choose from, the pizzas here are a must-try for any visitor. The crispy crust, fresh toppings, and authentic flavors make them truly stand out.

In addition to pizzas, the cafe offers an array of dishes inspired by Italian, Mexican, and Mediterranean cuisines. Some highly recommended options include spaghetti, carbonara, wraps, nachos, tacos, and even momos, making the menu diverse enough to suit all tastes. For beverages, they provide a range of coffee options and fresh juices, ensuring something for everyone.

Payments are hassle-free as they accept QR, Fonepay, cards, and cash. While the parking is paid and located in front of the restaurant, it is convenient and easily accessible. Roadhouse Cafe is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy flavorful dishes in a delightful setting."

4,"You know, the typical Roadhouse vibe cozy and nice ambiance. The pizza is decent, not great but not bad either, leaning towards the good side."
5,Very good food and services are quick
5,Awesome place to hangout with family and friends
2,One of my worst experience as the food was not that good for the price it came with and when I tried to cancel an order I placed while I was ordering they didn't even let me cancel and said the order went through and they can't do anything about it. They don't even have a parking lot and guests need to pay for parking.
5,"Food, vibe, price all on point.."
5,Great job aslam
5,"Aslam vai

Keep it going bro"
5,"Kafle Bhai was absolutely amazing, he was such a polite guy.. Enjoyed every single moment there"
5,"Place is good and atmosphere is also lit bit good .
And I found one server called devendra ,He is very cool  and he now's how to approach people "
1,"I recently visited your restaurant  2 time and unfortunately, my experience did not meet expectations. The food served was of poor quality served raw and frozen (pork ribs) though i have waited 1 hrs for it and in second visit order grilled fish which took 55min to serve . In addition, the service was disappointing water glass was not served though they bring water glass after 10-15 min the glass was full of dust and has tissue piece on it .
I had chosen your establishment expecting the high standards you are known for, so this was quite surprising and disappointing. I believe feedback is important, and I hope you will take steps to ensure better quality control and service training in the future."
5,I ordered pizza last time the pizza was great at that price and that taste they are serving very great food with very low price and the ambeiance was fabulous and also the waiters are very polite with us and they service was quite amazing i loved that place i must suggest everyone to go there and enjoy the vibes with your lovies collouegs and family i must suggest pizza and momo momo was very taste with affordable price

5,Cozy atmosphere with delightful environment and had an amazing time...
5,Cool experience and the service was top notch..
5,Had very delightful time at sekuwa by kilo with totally satisfying service!!!
5,"Had an amazing experience at sekuwa by kilo, Thanks to Mr kafle. Had a great time!!!"
1,"Extremely disappointing service at Sekuwa by Kilo, Jhamsikhel.
We were greeted with a dirty table, had to clean it ourselves, and waited 5 minutes before anyone took our order. Staff refused takeaway from the lunch menu despite serving it to others minutes earlier. Water was served without glasses, no cutlery was provided, and even after repeated requests, no one cared.

My buff momo arrived after 30 minutes, but my wife's chicken momo never came--staff didn't even know what was served or pending. The manager vanished, and instead of a proper bill, we were given an amount on a calculator.

Food might matter, but hospitality matters more--and here, it's completely missing.
Fell free to reach if you have any questions"
3,"I enjoyed their food, food tastes look and the ambiance and service was also perfect."
4,"Tried the pork and chicken sekuwa at Sekuwa by Kilo, Jhamsikhel -- both were evenly cooked, soft, and tender. Flavors were good, though the Nepali achar stole the show with its perfect seasoning.

No side dishes like bhuja or salad was a bit of a letdown, and parking's limited to roadside or the pay lot opposite.

Still, the spacious seating, comfy couches, polite staff, and chilled ambience make it worth a visit."
5,Good Service
4,"We ordered packed food for almost 45 people. The momo was amazing, however the momo achaar was in small proportion and the chowmein was horrible. The ambience is absolutely beautiful and cozy.
Would definitely recommend to try some more food."
5,Good place for food lover
5,"It's Worth your Money and Time.
I had the Lunch Offer of Rs 99/- for a plate of Buff Mo:Mo. It was good.

The Staffs were very much attentive.

I will be coming back again for some beer and Sekuwa."
4,Good food but always conj7sted and slow service.

5,"I recently visited this restaurant and was very impressed with the food. The biryani was flavorful and the sekuwa was excellent. The portions were also generous and well-priced.
The place was extremely crowded, which unfortunately seemed to affect the service. One of our items was prepared late, and there was a mix-up with the order. However, the staff quickly corrected the mistake and brought us the right dish.
Overall, the delicious food makes this place worth a visit, but you should be prepared for a potential wait if you go during a busy time."

5,"Had a delightful visit to this place recently and left fully satisfied.

The meat was beautifully marinated, bursting with flavor in every bite.

Portion enough to fill you up, but not overwhelming.

Barely had time to settle in before the food arrived. Appreciated the efficiency without compromising quality.

Drinks at MRP - Always a win when you don't have to pay a premium on refreshments.

-Spent a lovely time with close ones in a cozy, casual setting that made it all the more memorable.

Would definitely swing by again--solid food, fair prices, and fast, friendly service. Perfect spot for unwinding with good company."
1,"I went for dinner today. I was just amazed by their service as i had to wait an hour for a single peach ice tea. Truly a masterclass in slow motion service.

Food was so so and the service was even poorer. When i queried the server about my drinks and food, they seemed ignorant about what was happening.

Next visit ? - NEVER!!! Unless they improve their service and discover what ""customer service"" means, i wouldn't recommend anyone to visit even to my worst enemy."
5,"Sekuwa by Kilo is a great place to relax with friends or enjoy a meal with family. The sekuwa is packed with flavor and definitely a highlight! The high-roof design, outdoor seating, and cheerful vibe make the ambience inviting. It's family-friendly yet fun, with good music, chilled beer, and attentive service. They even replaced a salty momo without any fuss; great customer care! A go-to spot for good food, good times, and reasonable prices."
3,"Unfortunately, the pizza crust was overcooked, which really affected the overall taste. I was hoping for a better experience given the good reviews. I hope the kitchen takes more care in the future because the service was otherwise decent, and the atmosphere was nice."
5,Aslam Vai  hasso mitho
1,Third class service.
1,"We have been there first time yesterday worst experience ever I have in Kathmandu, customer service zero even manage don't know how to talk manner less , treated us like they are giving us free food, worst customer service worst experience I was about to make video and post but I didn't but never gone visit again "
5,No words. it's outstanding for everything
5,"Mr kafle's courteous attitude,and attention to detail significantly enhanced our dining experience. Enjoyed every single minute. Will visit again real soon,thanks Mr kafle...."
5,Mr kafle provided us truly exceptional service!!!
3,The overall experience was okayish. Sekuwa was tasty but a little oily. The ambience was nice but a bit crowded. A good spot to hang out with friends and family.

5,"I ate twice at this restaurant cause I liked it a lot. Both times I ordered the falafel platter with pita bread and it was delicious. It comes with fries, pita bread, falafel, fried aubergine slices, a small salad and three type of sauces (garlic mayo, a chili sauce and a tahin sauce) and all of it tastes fresh. The price is very good (450 rupees for the platter) cause it will fill you up completely. Recommended!"

5,"We had an excellent experience at Thamel Doner Kebab! My friend, uncle, and I ordered their shawarma wrapped in buckwheat bread, and it was absolutely delicious. The portion size was generous--just two shawarmas were more than enough for the three of us to share. The unique flavor of the buckwheat bread paired perfectly with the flavorful shawarma filling. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the overall ambiance was great. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a satisfying and unique dining experience in Thamel!"
5,"Food is 10/10 freshly cooked and delicious . Little bit more sauce in the wrap would be great.
Staffs are friendly."
5,They provide a refreshing alternative to traditional Nepali/Newari food in Kathmandu. We had the chicken doner kebabs (shawarma) and fries. The kebabs were great and the fries must be one of the best in town. I hope they can keep up the taste and portion sizes.
5,"Really great shawarma that i wasn't expecting here, in Nepal. You will get the decent food for cheap price"
4,Good food. Quite little places. Can accommodate 10 people at time

5,"Indeed very good service esp Ms Sonia Chemjong who assisted us throughout
Enjoyed all the food"
1,"I have been visiting Bagaicha since its opening in 2023 and always recommended it to family and friends for reunions. In the beginning, the cocktails were excellent, food was good, and service was acceptable for a new establishment. Unfortunately, my most recent visit was disappointing enough to make me reconsider ever going back.

We went on a Friday evening to celebrate my daughter's 2nd birthday and my in-laws' last night in Kathmandu. We had a reservation for seven adults and a child. On arrival, we were greeted warmly and given welcome drinks. Soon after, however, mistakes began piling up. Instead of a margarita cocktail, we were served a margarita pizza. The server encouraged us to keep it, and since my daughter likes pizza, we reluctantly agreed. Later, one of our appetizer orders (saphale) never arrived despite waiting for over an hour.

Our main courses were also poorly managed. The burger was served first, while the Nepali thali and tenderloin steak were delayed the longest. The steak was explained as being frozen, which should have been communicated before we ordered. When it finally came, it was overcooked and not what we had requested.

I raised these concerns with the manager, who was respectful, apologized, and agreed that we would not be charged for the pizza or missing appetizer. Unfortunately, when the bill came, our server argued in front of our guests that we had to pay for the pizza because it was consumed, directly contradicting the manager. The tone was confrontational and unprofessional, and the situation became embarrassing. A colleague eventually had to step in and apologize.

While many staff members were polite, this one interaction overshadowed the entire evening. What should have been a special family celebration turned into a frustrating experience.

Bagaicha once held great promise, but inconsistent service and poor management have eroded that. Sadly, after being a loyal customer since its opening, I will not be recommending or returning in the future"
5,Should visit once feel it
4,Variety
5,"Great experience,10/10 service and ambience plus such a charming and friendly host ms. Sonia chemjong(she's the best in hospitality and serving ). Must visit place"
1,Failed logistics. They have attempted a good concept but completely failed on execution. We had to wait 1hr for our valet car when returning after dining. And one of my dish took 2 hrs.
5,food was too delicious. we all loved it. had a really great time.
5,"Sriza shikha kamana were amazing
Food was 10/10 such a good service will definitely vist again"
5,"The service, ambiance and food was very good.... Samir was very friendly and helpful"
5,"Had an absolutely delightful experience dining here, today and on previous occasions. The service and the hospitality are really good.

We chose to sit indoors because we were looking to have a quiet time. The outdoor seating were lively and upbeat yet the indoors maintained the quiet atmosphere we were looking for.

The only picture I took - Tan Tan Ramen. Creamy and really tasty.

The food tasted as good as it looked. The selection of food in my opinion is good as well. Although there are various seating spaces, the warmth offers a seamless transition to all.

We had the absolute pleasure of being served by Ms. Soni Tamang and she made the experience even more lovely. I'd like to extend my warm gratitude to her and the staff that continue to provide such wonderful service."

5,"We had an absolutely amazing dinner experience! The variety was incredible -- from the beautifully arranged Japanese platters and delicious bento-style dinner boxes to flavorful Tibetan dishes and classic Indian favorites, every item was a treat. Each dish was full of flavor, well-prepared, and clearly made with care. The presentation was thoughtful, the portions generous, and the overall atmosphere made the evening even more special. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys diverse and delicious cuisine under one roof. Can't wait to visit again!"

1,"Worst management ever seen, cost is totally expensive I  ordered a cocktail name whiskey old fashioned its a American bourbon cocktail but beside using bornon or American whiskey the bar team pour and used domestic whiskey named old durbar.

5,"Absolutely Delightful - A Must-Visit in Kathmandu

I cannot believe I had my bestest time at Le Sherpa--what an extraordinary place tucked away in the middle of bustling Kathmandu. From the moment I walked in, the ambience captured my heart. The setting is serene and beautifully designed, with warm lights, tasteful decor, and a courtyard that brings a touch of nature to the dining experience. It's perfect for a calm, fine-dining evening.

Now let's talk about the food--absolutely divine! I had a tofu-based dish (I wish I could remember the name!) and a refreshing salad, and both were simply unforgettable. The tofu was delicate yet flavorful, paired with thoughtful sides that complemented the texture and spices. The salad was fresh, vibrant, and artfully plated, making each bite feel like a celebration of natural flavors. Every dish felt intentional and beautifully balanced.

The service was top-tier. The staff were polite, attentive, and genuinely kind--always ready to guide without being overbearing. Their attention to detail and warm approach made me feel relaxed and well cared for throughout the evening.

Le Sherpa is not just a restaurant--it's an experience. The calm, the quality, and the aesthetic appeal all come together to create something truly special.

Oopss!! Still can't get over how good everything was! This place is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy fine dining in Kathmandu. I'll absolutely be coming back."
5,"Romi was fantastic and had such a cheerful personality, which made the food and atmosphere even more enjoyable."
3,Went for farmers marker experience !!!
5,"Scenic, relaxed, excellent service, fantastic food."
5,"An absolutely outstanding experience! The food was a perfect 10/10. The ambience was just as impressive. Hospitality was warm and welcoming. But the real standout was the service--beyond exceptional, a well-deserved 100/10! Highly recommend!"
5,"Wonderful experience
Food was exceptional
Service from Sugam was marvellous he is such a gentleman,professional and fun."
4,Looks great but pricy
5,"The BEST dinner in Nepal! From start to finish the whole evening was exceptional, the food was fresh and full of flavour and the atmosphere was perfect. Thankyou so much for a beautiful evening!"
5,"My friends and I enjoyed a 5-course Christmas dinner here. The food was delicious and presented beautifully. Our waiter, Prajwal, was attentive and hard working. We will definitely return for more dining experiences in this gem of a restaurant."
5,Really good service and the ambience was the best.
5,"Nous venons de sortir du dejeuner de Noel. C'etait delicieux, l'equipe est adorable et le service parfait. Merci beaucoup pour tout. Nous recommandons cet endroit vivement pour y passer un moment unique."
5,"Great company, great atmosphere! Highly recommend for nice food and drinks"
4,"It's a nice modern restaurant. We had a group dinner here. I had the tofu with brown rice and a sauce. It tasted okay. It was very nice to get brown rice which seems to be rarely served in Nepal.
The salad was very good and the chocolate brownie was, too."
4,The food was mediocre and quite expensive  but the vibe over there is always good on a. Saturday morning
2,"Na ja, auf nobel gemacht, aber man verlasst den Tempel hungrig fur viel Geld. Sehr steif alles, Essen schmecht ganz gut, aber eben wenig, Nachschlag gibt es nicht. Sehr sauber alles, aber noch nie so ein schlechten Kaffee getrunken, dunkles Wasser. Selbst die Krauterbutter schmeckt nach nix. Zudem habe ich das teuerste Bier in ganz Nepal hier getrunken, eine Flasche Gorkha fur sage und schreibe 7 Eur.  Das Ambiente selbst ist aber ganz nett.  Aus unserer Sicht aber eine Fehlentscheidung."
5,Saturday Market  visit was good
5,Excellent food and service
5,Good food `aahaar`r`ysd sa`aad brryaakaasdii
5,"It was an amazing fine dining experience.
Starters to all course and all listed cuisine were finest.

I personally loved Mushroom Raviloi  which is also chef's recommendations.

Do try Sherpa Soup

Servers were all nice.

Entrance to the cafe and location is quite confusing. Do call and ask for directions."
5,Farmers market and an excellent cafe
5,"Great spot for a comfortable, quality, and modern dining experience in Kathmandu. The beautiful porch dining space was breezy and enjoyed a nice view of a small garden courtyard. Staff were professional and timely. Food was pretty good too, though the ambiance and service were the real gems here. Surprisingly quiet with being in the heart of town. Having a few shopping spots in the same area was also a nice bonus. I recommend this place for a brunch with the wife or even the family as the kids can run around in the garden area. Enjoy!"
1,"The restaurant tries to serve fancy western kitchen but does not provide. The dishes look good and are well presented but lack taste. The lamb was announced to be braised but simply was raw. The creme brulee was not brulee at all. Again nicely presented but without taste.
Maybe try to cultivate Nepalese kitchen that is so rich instead of trying to make weak copies of western cuisine."
5,Trendiges cool eingerichtetes Lokal mit asiatischer Fusionkuche. Das Lokal befindet sich einem kleinen Hof mit Geschaften lokaler Kunstler und Boutiquen. Ein Highlight.
5,Great food and very welcoming service. I like the nature vibes
4,"A cool hangout spot with tasty bites and a chill vibe, perfect for a group to unwind and dine."
5,"The best food experience i've had in a while, literally wiped the plate of ravioli clean. Amazing food. Servers were the best,  efficient and attentive.
The only thing that bothered me was the sheer number of mosquitoes, i wish they could do something about it though, otherwise a perfect place."
3,"Pricey, however."
5,Wonderful food and beautiful place
4,Overrated place
5,"Loved the ambience, menu, and the service"
5,"Farmers market was a fresh concept, really enjoyed a variety of foods in one place.
A bit pricey though worth it."
5,"It was hard to find the entrance of the restaurant, finally I found it, it was through the museum an Airbnb at Panipokhari.  The ambience of the restaurant looked attractive but was like sitting on a terrace. Staffs were professional, polite & attentive. Mixed mushroom with poached egg on top was delicious.  Pan seared trout fillets which came with mashed potatoes & vegs was really looked impressive  though a bit expensive but tasted excellent.  Really a great place for fine dining in Kathmandu."
4,"such a great ambience!
tranquil!"
5,"We had spinach agnolotti and pesto farfalle. I kinda liked them - they're slightly too oily but quite interesting combination of ingredients. Portion was big, we didn't finish it and brought leftovers with us to eat while traveling around town.

Atmosphere is wonderful and the warm drinks are nice."
1,"Don't even know what's the inside like, had to stay in the car so it didn't get locked.
No parking but you have the best reviews? How?
Stupid question ik, everyone that comes here can afford a driver/ pathao /a family or friend that will wait outside."
5,Best cheese in the town! Nice vibes.
4,"Eine Oase der Ruhe inmitten des chaotischen Stadtlebens draussen. Ausgezeichneter Service. 
Leider war das Hauptgericht, nicht das was es versprochen hatte, das Fleisch, Braised Beef, war zah, obwohl medium bestellt, und richtig warm es auch nicht, genau wie die Beilagen. Das einzige was richtig heiss war, war die Suppe, der Nachtisch hat es wieder herausgerissen  wir hatten es besser in Erinnerung, wo wir vor Jahren schon Mal da waren. Diesmal Le Sherpa war das leider nichts."
5,Excellent food and service. Very good value for fine dining. Best spot in Kathmandu!
5,Perfect for a Saturday brunch
2,Went to try breakfast and I was really disappointed!!! Regretted going there and won't prolly go back
5,"32 Marriage Anniversary so we went to Le Sherpa in a cold 26 January night... devoid of any souls because of Omicron the whole place was for us. Luckily all heaters we switched on kindly and after we opened a bottle of wine we were warm and happy. The soups were amazing, prawn starters good too. The Australian lamb was delicious and the array of veggies were generous too. Loved the Mustang organic potatoes but did not like the carrots which were big and not organic at all. Le Sherpa runs the Farmers Market every Saturday so please do give organic veggies & hike the price reasonably. Loved everything but the shaky table"
5,"""Le Sherpa Restaurant exceeded my expectations with its delightful ambiance, impeccable service, and a menu that showcases a perfect blend of flavors. A must-visit for a memorable dining experience!"""
4,Good food and budget friendly compared to some other places in the area. Drinks were good too
4,Overall good food with reasonable price.
1,"Worse place and rot food. It seems like place is hygenic and better place to stay and kill your hunger but today what i found there is, meat inside momo was too rot that it was smelling too bad but stil there staff didnot even apologize instead say we will replace. When i asked why food was not checked then replied happens sometime. And the cashier was looking at me too badly. Money minded freaks"
5,Everything average
1,"worst hookha ..
order jeera rice and grill chicken but it was nothing like I ordered..
it tasted horrible"
1,I went 10 years ago and i liked that time so after 10 years I went again to enjoy the food but my expectations was really awful. They were too careless. Raw blood was coming out from fried grilled chicken because it was under cooked and very bad smell from chicken. I will never go to this place again.
5,Burger was good 
1,"As many said, they really serve undercooked food. I have ordered cfc and grilled hot wings both was undercooked. I have been there before but now quality has gone down."
4,good
1,We got the burnt chowmein and biryani is so undercooked.. It's just waste of money .. I'm so angry and frustrate about it
2,The upper floor has a nice ambience but the food isn't good and prices are too high for it
1,"The service is too poor, extreme late,  this type of service will give bad name to other branch of chicken stations too."
4,"Chicken Station in Jhamsikhel is a great spot for tasty food at affordable prices. The menu features a variety of chicken dishes that are well-prepared and flavorful, making it a solid choice for a satisfying meal without breaking the bank. The casual setting adds to its appeal, providing a relaxed dining experience."
4,Nice place to have chicken items but the Service is slow and I have to reach out to somebody every time even when they are not busy
3,Our chicken wasn't cooked properly so just throw it away. Staffs were not willing to give us a refund
1,I ordered food from here and the  chicken rice ball is good as well as the burger is not properly cooked the meat is raw I just vomit rn I would not refer anyone to order or go there 
2,good
1,Ownership is has changed. Order didn't came for an hour. Not suggested. Lack the good responce .
4,"Overall everything is good.Can hangout with your loved one and friends with good food and vibes.

I don't recommend crunchy chicken burgers
It has lots of mayonnaise only.
Elese everything is good."
1,"Only c momo and ice is good. The name is chicken station but the main thing grilled chicken is bad in taste too.

So I don't recommend this place if you want to enjoy good food but in  case of atmosphere it is average"
3,That nice
1,Unfriendly for non-smokers. Should say no entry for children if there is no 'no smoking zone'.
4,Slow service. Strictly don't try spicy potato fry. Good ambience though.
4,Food here tastes amazing and the service is also good.
1,Disappointments
4,Chicken mo:mo and wings was really good.
1,"Chicken station at jhamsikhel, they have ok service but now they have very worst food, we had crunchy chicken but it was not cook properly, bad smell of oil. Chicken was smelly when we had burger inside it has found chowmin noodles. Before it was good. Now, they do not have good quality of food. Very embarrassing."
2,Food......
4,Kinda expensive for the taste
2,Not worth the price.
3,Just a Regular Burger.
2,Pizza was not that great and they charged full price on combo meal but forgot to give Coke other than that everything's good
1,"Worst fried chicken
Will never visit again "
1,"The ambience is nice, chill. But the main thing is why we are going there, we are going there for the food not the ambiences and all, food wasn't as good as it was before, we almost waited for an hour and finally we have our food in front of us but we have no spoons. How can we eat? And the food totally disappointed us. Some people who came after us already ate and leave the place while we were waiting there. Don't just focus on making a good ambience and all. Please make the food better and also the service."
5,"ambiance was good, fried chicken was so satisfying"
4,Decent outlet in jhamsikhel. Good value for money.
1,"Terrible service, they made us pay for food we didn't order just because they made it. Chicken popcorn was mid and served cold. Long waiting time for drinks."
4,Food and service is nice
3,"chicken station has been revamped with new cabinets, rooms, and a big space. While the service was still fast, I must say that the food served wasn't as good as it used to be. I tried their platter and found that the portion size wasn't worth the price and the food was just average. Even their famous animal fries, which used to be my favorite, have been degraded in taste. I hope they take note of this and pay more attention to the quality of the food they serve. it's still a decent place, but it could be better."
5,Hot chicken was fantastic hajur
1,"Cold Burger was served,
Plate of Momo was very sad.
Chicken station Jhamsikhel,
Was so fugging bad..

Boo, what a bummer!
Bland and basic, my burger, no wonder,
Bad buns, barely edible, I'm Baffled,
why even bother with this hunger?"
5,"Very nice place, comfy and cool. The food is very good and tasty. You can choose among different dishes. I've tried paneer, mutton, eggs and vegetables and it was all super.
You can also choose if you want a small or big size, nice"
5,"Fantastic food and drinks, stellar dining experience overall. The staff are also very helpful, and the ladyboss is around to oversee things.

They have a pretty good spread of local cuisine. I love their non-veg options, particularly their mutton dishes. Their Chicken Momo (Jhol) is amazing. Their veg options are also great.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements, so you can choose your ambience. Overall, a good place for a meal and chill."
5,"One of the best places to have Thakali Thali around Thamel. Tried out the thali from some places around and this definitely stood out! The taste, portion size and service amazing and the staff make sure that you are having a great experience!"
5,Exzellent service of Dhiraj. Tanks a lot!! We like to come back!
5,Yesterday went with family to have lunch. The service was fantastic and the food was very tasty. We had chicken and mutton thakali which was awesome.The hotel staff explained us about the food and we're very very attentive. The owner was also around with a beautiful smile. The place gives a party or festival vibe and the food adds up to have a great quality time experience. Will definitely visit again.
5,The thakali was the best i have ever had. Staff were really professional and friendly. The owner was also really nice. She assisted us really well. Will be coming back again.

5,Ahiraj y Rohit nos dieron una gran bienvenida a Nepal!! Y la comida nepali estaba buenisima!! Nos encanto
3,Do not order the mutton legs! It's literally just skin and bones! Apart from that the place was cozy and the waiters were friendly and quick. Very importante! The toilet was not so clean. 
4,Best thakali in KTM valley. Staff were really professional and friendly. The thakali set was really best.
5,All good dami 
5,"To begin with the ambience was perfect, we had our pet along and they even accommodate her. The staff is amazing and very polite and were very courteous, special mention to Driraj and Sisir who provided excellent service and the hospitality is top notch. Loved it."
1,"Im not sure they knowns hospitality
Very bad service thank you"
5,"I had an amazing dining experience at Kho Hang Restaurant! The ambiance is cozy yet vibrant, the food is flavorful and authentic, and the service is top-notch. Every dish we tried was delicious -- from the juicy momos to the perfectly spiced thukpa, everything tasted fresh and well-prepared.

What truly made our visit special was the exceptional service. A big shoutout to Dhiraj and Rohit, who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. They were attentive, friendly, and had great knowledge of the menu. Their warm hospitality added a personal touch that made the meal even more enjoyable.

Highly recommend Kho Hang for anyone looking for a great place to enjoy Nepali cuisine with excellent service. I'll definitely be coming back!"

4,"Posetili vashe zavedenie, v celom ostalis dovolny -- eda vkusnaya, horosho poel, obstanovka priyatnaya. No hochu ostavit obratnuyu svyaz po servisu.

Thanks to the staff Nabin for giving us good service as well."

5,Great hospitality with a good service
5,"It was absolutely delicious, the buff oil on the rice, gave to the Dal Bath the perfect touch.  Thanks Dhiraj who was really helpfull about how the Thali works, and offering allways the extras of the Thali. I was really happy to chose this place, for sure will come back again."
5,Thank you for hosting us ! Everything was super amazing . Hoping to visit soon
5,Best thakali restaurant with the best dal bhat in town. I've been here for more than 6 times since I'm in Nepal. I got addicted to paneer
1,"I had ordered one Chicken Thakali set and Aalu Jimbu Sukuti from Pathao where I had clearly written an instruction to add extra rice and chicke gravy but at last, I received without any extras and even the original portion was not full enough. The portion of every item was literrally as same one when we sit in their place n use to get served at first glance. Aalu Jimbu Sukuti was pathetic in taste. They charge so enough as much as of other popular Thakali places but their service was hilarious. So dissapointing. Never gonna order again from here and  recommend to others as well. Such a great experience Khohang Thakali has provided to its very new customer who could be the regular one in future."
5,"great food, great employees and space"
5,Food is simply awesome from all perspective...
5,"Absolutely loved my experience at Khohang Taste of Thakali! The food was authentic and bursting with flavor, and the service was top-notch. A big shoutout to Dhiraj for being so warm, attentive, and helpful throughout the meal. Highly recommend for anyone craving delicious Nepali cuisine!"
5,Laziz xaw
5,Really good thakali food.
5,"This restaurant is a must visit whilst in Kathmandu.
The staff provide incredible service throughout, very attentive and accommodating. Our waiter (Kuber) was so friendly and polite, made the best experience even better.

Me and my partner both had the veg Thakali, they had rice, I had dhindo. The food was the best we have had travelling in Nepal and India. Dhal bat power!!! Dherai mitho.

For drinks we had the bottle of Nepali red wine (pataleban), and iced tea which both were great.

Highly recommend."
5,"If you're looking for a delicious, authentic Dal Bhat in a cozy and quiet setting with excellent service, Kohang - Taste of Thakali is the place to go.

From the moment you arrive, you'll be welcomed with open arms. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, especially waiter Nabin, who made our visit extra special with his warm smile and fast, professional service.

The food is served quickly, full of flavor, and prepared with care. If Dal Bhat is what you're craving, don't think twice! Go to Kohang. You definitely won't regret it!"
5,"Had an amazing meal at Khohang Taste of Thakali in Kathmandu! The dal bhat was comforting and packed with flavor, and the buckwheat pancakes were a surprise hit -- soft, earthy, and delicious. The mutton curry was rich and perfectly spiced. The staff were warm and generous, even letting us try a few local specialties on the house. A simple, authentic experience that truly felt like home-cooked Nepali food. Thanks to Dhiraj our server for this amazing experience!"
5,Amazing food had the best meal of the last four days . Dhiraj was an amazing host and provided excellent service which was a topping on the cake with an amazing food
5,A good restaurant with an amazing ambience with good food and good service from dhiraj

And best service

I would like to recommend everyone visit and test the foods for khohang restaurant.."
5,One of the perfect place and taste for Thakali.
5,Best service ever
5,"The food was great, felt like I was eating at home. Also to mention our host suman was very jolly and welcoming. Besides that I got the opportunity to meet both of the owners who turned out to be sisters. They asked us about the food and were eager for our feedback. Definitely will comeback with my family and friends.... if you have time try out their cultural program."
5,I have mutton leg and also chicken thakali..The test is really good and flavorful. I like mutton leg the most very tender.. will be back for sure
5,"Khohang was recommended by our hotel as a great place to explore authentic Nepali flavors -- and it definitely offers a unique experience. The set Thakali menu is well-curated, and I really enjoyed the vegetarian thali with nettle soup and seasonal dishes. The food was nicely presented and full of traditional taste, served in beautiful brass bowls. However, portions felt a bit small, and compared to other places in Kathmandu, the price was on the higher side. Still, it's a lovely way to experience Thakali hospitality and heritage."
5,"Fantastic restaurant, Dhiraj and Kuber are the friendliest guys youll meet with excellent customer service! The 6 course menu is the best ever, we are going to miss this lovely nepalese food!!!"
1,This is the veg thakali i got for 600
5,"Khohang has a very laid back vibe, amazing atmosphere to have a calm and cozy lunch.

5,Love everything about this place. Good food good vibes and the service is great too! Had a great experience here. Love from Malaysia 
5,Dhiraj is competent and very professional. The owner of the place was very accommodating as well. Thali is a must try for first-timer. Mo-mo was very juicy and exploded upon biting.
5,Delicious Dal Bhat  craft beer and local moonshine  very nice service 
5,Had the paneer dal bhat and it was the best dal bhat I've had. The price was super reasonable for the amount of food you get. Can pay by card! The staff is so wonderful and kind as well. A must visit in Kathmandu!
5,Excellent food and service and staff
5,Best Nepalese dish I had in Kathmandu. Had the mix platter which is full of flavors. Enjoyed the warm service too.
4,Everything was good but during a visit we go to experience a lot of flies flying around our dish if that could be resolved we could be thankful.
5,"We walked past this restaurant and we decided to look at the menu which was varied and well priced.
We decided to eat here and the food was fantastic with generous portions and very well presented and it didn't take long for the food to arrive.
The service from the moment we arrived until we left was impeccable and we will no doubt be back here soon."
5,"The place was amazing. It was a cultural night and we really enjoyed the ambiance and the the foods too. The songs were also folk songs which we have heard growing up. Like: Resham Firiri, Kya Ramro Sau Bari and others too.  At last the Thakali was great too. And I also tried my first Raksi (Nepali Wine). But I didn't like it very much. Will be my first and the last."
5,Excellent service and food!

5,Beautiful quiet place! Nice service and really good food! Thank you swostika!
5,Biki was great thank you so much. Lovely setting especially!
5,"The place is perfect, I came to eat alone and the atmosphere was very calm, just what I needed. The food was excellent and the service from the team was very reactive, especially Swostika. They even provided me with mosquito repellent as soon as I settled in. I highly recommend this restaurant-cafe !"
5,I have a wonderful thakali which feels like home. Service was really great.Thankyou biki and swastika for wonderful service
5,"The food was really good, ambience  was awesome and peaceful.I was fully satisfied with the service and food .Bishal dai was really helpful"
5,A quite and peaceful garden in the middle of chaotic lalitpur. Amazing food quality and staff. quick and warm staffs. recommend10/10 
5,I had the vegetarian Thakali and it was very tasty. The cocktails were also delicious and generous. The back garden is a beautiful and quiet respite from the chaos of central Patan. Our waitress Swostika was kind and attentive.
5,"Such a nice place to unwind, with delicious food and amazing service. Biki has been so kind and attentive. I will come back!"
5,Very friendly and helpful. Good place to visit for a date.
5,Love this cafe ! Always a great experience with tasty foods specially when Biki is working .

5,"The place is really beautiful and peaceful. Right in the middle of Patan. The food was also great. Balanced flavours and good portions. Biki was a really great staff who helped us with everything! We had a three course meal of starter, drink, main dish and desserts. Overall 5/5."
5,The food was very good. Biki was a great server. I recommend this place.
3,It was my second time with my family here and I was disappointed this time. We booked earlier as we had a head count of 8. There was zero coordination between staff. We ordered a dish which was missed and had to cancel. The food wasn't as great as before. Expected better.
3,It has the vibe of traditional look but furnitures are not that well to be
4,"Average
Food taste is okayish not that great.."
5,"Absolutely loved it here! Ordered the chicken burger, mushroom pasta and chicken momo, and the dishes exceeded all our expectations. Best restaurant we've eaten at in Nepal so far! Food was also very cheap, nearly half the price of other restaurants we went to and the ambience and vibe was unmatched. 10/10, would definitely recommend to everyone!"
4,Nice ambience and good vibes in an old heritage renovated house with Garden
2,"The ambience and atmosphere were truly impressive -- a great place to unwind and enjoy the setting. However, the food was quite disappointing. Vegetarian options were particularly underwhelming, both in variety, quality, and quantity."
5,Food is tasty and the price is relatively cheaper for the quality. Very peaceful and aesthetic ambience. Really a good place to hangout with friends.
5,"Cocktails exceptional (recommend the whiskey sour), great mix of Nepali and western dishes and a beautiful garden with aesthetic architecture and lighting"
5,"I visited Patan for 2 days and it's my favourite restaurant. Food is good and wine too.

Service is not as good as the food though. One waiter was rather rude and generally, the service is slow.....so find elsewhere if you're super hungry.

I love their pasta dishes!"
4,"The atmosphere is overwhelming, loved the ambience. Service was also genuinely good. Food was also tasty enough but a bit expensive and may not be budget friendly for all. Overall a great place."
5,"Very nice.
But they should increase their veggie options.
Anyways a good place to rest."
5,Un giardino nascosto tra le vie caotiche di Patan.. piatti deliziosi e ben preparati (e lo dice un'italiana) bravi!
4,Hospitality and ambience in this restaurant is great. The menu is a mix of continental and Nepali cuisines (bit on a expensive side) but serves its value with the taste. A great varieties of cocktails and mocktails are also worth giving a try
5,"Super atmospheric garden between newari buildings, very friendly service by Tika and really delicious burgers! Highly recommended!"
3,"The ambience and service is really nice, but the peach iced tea was disappointing."
5,Really enjoyed our meal here and Tika was a lovely server.
3,"Cafe with good ambiance in Patan with cozy seating, but the food was underwhelming. Great presentation, weak flavors, and limited options."
5,"Great spot for a beer, in a calm and serene garden tucked away off a busy street. Came back for dinner and the veg thakali was good; portions could have been more generous but you do get refills!"
5,"Delicious food in a beautiful garden. We ate here a couple of times during our stay and everything was just right, from the friendly service to the tasty food. Our favourite was the thakali set. Yum! Sorry for no photos, but we were too busy enjoying our meal."
5,Ochen atmosfernoe mesto s priyatnoy energetikoy 
5,Gatekeeping worthy.
5,Very nice Service by Tika. Friendly and attentive.
5,"Il Caffe espresso e buonissimo (parola di italiana), super consigliato!"
5,"just had some drinks, definitely gonna go again to try some food

the place was so nice i could sit there the whole day, with a touch of greenery, it had so much space than we had expected, the staff were also nice."
4,The ambience is super good and the staffs are really humble and helpful too. I had ordered coffee and it was quite good as well
4,Virkelig dejlig oase med en meget charmerende have. Meget laekker mad og tak til Mandy som er den hyggeligste smilende tjener .
1,"Outside ambiance, nothing is recommended for the restaurant.  Food does not have any salt, portion sizes are very small (one pasta is not even sufficient for kids), much higher prices compared to local places."
4,"Wonderful place located in a heritage structure and has a garden tucked away in the back. Food was nice, service was warm and friendly."
5,"Peaceful place, great food, very friendly staff and reasonable prices. Highly recommended."
4,The thing about a garden along with a cafe is very fascinating and unique in Kathmandu. Definitely visit
2,"The ambience of the place was truly impressive, creating a wonderful atmosphere that was hard to beat. Additionally, the cleanliness was remarkable, contributing to an overall feeling of comfort. However, the highlight was unfortunately overshadowed by the food, which I found to be quite disappointing; even the Newari cuisine, which I had looked forward to, did not meet my expectations."
2,"My penne arrabbiata was incredibly salty. The margarita pizza was flavorless. The grilled veggies and garlic spinach on the side were good, but the portion sizes were laughably small. All unforgivable at this price point. The worst meal we've had in Nepal!"
2,"vkl `l hpnym hpytsvt sbbh
l shvvh"
2,"Staff were nice. But the pasta was incredibly salty, and the spinach and vegetable sides were absolutely tiny.

The biggest disappointment though was my pizza - it had no flavour. I have no idea how the chef managed to do this, it was literally FLAVOURLESS - I have never ever experienced this before - the cheese, the tomato sauce, the base all had no taste.

If you're in the area and craving italian food, you should go to Fire & Ice. It's round the corner, it's the same price, and the taste/quality is SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!"
5,Heel lekker gegeten. Super service!
5,"Marco Polo Restaurant offers an exceptional dining experience with a warm ambiance and attentive service. The spuntini di polo appetizer was perfectly crispy, while the spaghetti seefood and grilled chicken souvlaki were both flavorful and beautifully presented. The volcano dessert was a delightful end to the meal. Highly recommend for anyone seeking delicious food and a welcoming atmosphere!"
5,Delicious pizza in Kathmandu!
5,Great Calzone! Perfectly cooked and full of flavour
1,"I recently ordered from Marco Polo Restaurant and had an extremely disappointing experience. I ordered the Peccato Al Fiume, and what I received was completely unacceptable. The portion size was tiny--just four slices of vegetables and a baby portion of macaroni with prawn. For the price I paid, the quantity and quality were nowhere near satisfactory.

Additionally, I ordered the Tuna Pizza, which was equally disappointing. It was completely tasteless, and to make matters worse, there was no tuna on the pizza at all. It felt like I was paying Rs. 2578 for a name rather than the actual dish.

I immediately reported this to Foodmandu, as it felt like the restaurant was blatantly overcharging and under-delivering. Marco Polo Restaurant needs to seriously improve its food quality, portion sizes, and pricing to avoid losing customers. As it stands, I won't be ordering from Marco polo restaurant again and recommened to other as well be aware this kind I'd restaurant just trying to rub the customers."
5,Great food. Amazing service. Highly recommend this place!!!
1,Europeans please do not be fooled by the reviews like I was  . This is the worst Italian restaurant in Asia I have ever been to ( the staff are lovely and the restaurant is pretty ) but the cheese ! It's an Italian restaurant and you serve me yak butter instead of feta cheese ? This was really shocking and gross because the quantity of butter was super fatty ( and I love butter but even I can't eat straight butter especially when I ordered feta and they just layer the pizza with butter instead ) . They also didn't put Parmesan in my pasta and charged me for the imported good without telling me until I questioned it because there was no cheese on my pasta instead. This  was disappointing as I came there for the cheese . I was gutted as I was so excited for cheese and believed the good reviews . I don't expect the same standards as Europe but butter instead of cheese ? And no Parmesan? You are NOT an Italian you are a  wood fire pizza with no passable cheese just rename yourself please or import the cheese and charge extra .
5,"On my stay in Kathmandu i eat here three times. Located in the mall, the food is delicious,

The staff are very professional and prompt with your orders. I especially the two  ladies, I really appreciated the service they provided. Im back in London Uk  now but always do think of this place and the staff 

Definitely recommend."
1,"Forget this place. Inside the calzone I found only cheese and tomato sauce.
Poor quality and higher price for nothing"
5,"If you are looking for delicious Italian food, this could it to satisfy you. Kinna hard to find this place in the mall but once you do, you are treated to an elegant dining ambience with window-view into the kitchen.

The food was lip-licking amazing, from pizza to pasta, and leaving you wanting more! The Mediterranean (chicken souvlaki) wasn't that authentic - potato was too blend instead of the traditional butter and zesty lemon taste.

The staff was very professional and prompt with your orders. I especially appreciated the sign in the toilet (see pic!).

Definitely recommend giving this place a try for delicious Italian food.

 Since the mall doesn't have a directory, it is confusing to me to locate this place. When you enter the mall, there is a stand on your right with Marcopolo sign indicating it is on 1st floor but not clear where. So follow the set of escalators in front of the stand and then turn right from the escalator once you reach 1st floor and the restaurant is at the end. If you take the other escalator that brings you to the toilet, it's the left side hallway that brings you to the restaurant (not the long hallway on the right).

 I appreciate it is cultural to speak loudly on the phone and put the conversation on speaker. I feel the staff should be more in tune with patrons who are not mindful of using indoor voice, so other patrons trying to enjoy their dining aren't annoyed by the loud phone conversation. It's just general courtesy. "
4,Good pasta and very friendly staff. Liked the mocktails 
4,friendly environment .I suggest to come and enjoy the time and meal
5,"One of the best pizza that I've ever had. Haven't tried other dishes yet. The ambience was good. The server was cute, friendly and had excellent demeanor. Definitely worth a visit."
5,It was so good 
2,"Hem vingut aqui seguint les ressenyes i alguns blogs que parlaven de les millors pizzes de Katmandu. Hem sortit decebuts. Les pizzes mig crues, amb poca coherencia d'ingredients o fins i tot escassos. Hem provat una calzone i la pizza Marcopolo (si un restaurant te una pizza amb el seu nom sempre esta be provar-la; segur que l'han pensat amb delicadesa). Doncs res de res, la pizza mes barata del super es mes bona. Sap greu perque l'ambient es xulo i podria ser un molt bon restaurant, pero la relacio qualitat-preu no es gens bona."
3,My pizza was nothing special - salami looked liked sausage. If you want real pizza you can find many way better places.
5,mvd nhnnv mhvkl vhvvyrh
5,Abbiamo mangiato molto bene in un locale molto carino! Ottimo servizio!
5,I never expected they give that kind of service it was really  good  food service staff .. also environment  ..love this place 
3,"Zamowilam na obiad pizze z owocami morza - brakowalo polowy skladnikow wymienionych w menu, w tym krewetek. Na deser zamowilam lody z bita smietana i pistacjami ale dostalam same lody. Obsluga nie informuje o braku skladnikow. Dania wybrakowane ale calkiem smaczne."
5,Amazing food and service
5,Great place to eat. I had the pasta and it was delicious. I would definitely go back and you should visit also.
4,"Nice service, tried a Nepalitana Pizza which was quite fascinating to see.. taste was only fine tho. Overall Great"
4,"Personale attento e servizievole, ambiente gradevole pero un po' scuro.
Locale dotato di forno a legna, la pizza non era male, immagino che trovare una buona mozzarella in Nepal non sia facile.

Abbiamo anche preso il dolce, niente di sopraffino ma apprezzabile lo sforzo.

Caro per la media."
5,"Good cheese pizza. I was skeptical at first, but it was worth eating here even if the cost is higher than other places. It is located in the mall."
5,"Their Marcopolo pizza, chicken pesto panini sandwich with its smoky flavor, and aglio e olio pasta, which was one of the best I've had, were all delightful. The spicy mango and strawberry colada mocktails were also fantastic. Looking forward to returning to explore more dishes on their menu!"
5,Super restaurant avec de tres bonnes pizzas au feu de bois. Un peu cher mais la qualite est la. Nous y sommes retournes 4 ou 5 fois durant notre sejour.
4,Lekkere risotto en cheesecake!
5,The Bruschetta is truly one of the best I've experienced in Nepal. Food is delicious with great service. I'll be back to try the amazing pizza!
3,Lunghi come la fame...quando e' arrivato il mio piatto mio marito aveva gia finito il suo da 10 min
5,"very nice pizza!
bit expensive but worth it"
5,"Probably the best pizza I have ever had.
**bit tricky to find following google maps"
5,"Wonderful Service And Excellent Pizza . i came with my frn And family really delicious pizza and cheese cake , i am very  enjoyed there. Once again thank you marcopolo Resturent for your personalized Service."
5,"Alles wunderbar!

Befindet sich im ersten Stock des Einkaufszentrums."
5,Just what was needed after completing a 14 day trek to Basecamp. The pizza was amazing
5,L'unico ristorante ad offrire vera cucina Italiana a Katmandu. Cibo servizio ottimi.
5,"A dark themed Italian restaurant that serves some amazing food and drinks. The calzone here is a must try. Likewise, would recommend requesting the paradise mocktail which I truly enjoyed. Its not on the menu yet but try asking for it. Likewise, it might be a bit expensive but definitely worth the price paid."
2,"Unfortunately we didn't enjoy the food. The pizzas were cheese-heavy, oily and with little taste (the base tomato sauce had zero flavour?!) - we were a bit confused as it looked amazing and has great reviews. We only ate half and left the rest. We've tried a few different places in KTM and it was sadly the worst (so far). Maybe we'll give it another try one day. Staff were good, the pasta was OK."
5,"Nestled in the vibrant Thamel district of Kathmandu, Nepal, this cozy eatery is a haven of warmth and inviting ambiance. The pizza here is a crowd-pleaser with its bubbly cheese and tangy sauce. Their Melanzane alla Parmigiana is a rich, layered delight that comforts the soul. The calzone is a pocket of culinary joy, stuffed with flavorful ingredients. For dessert, the cheesecake stands out as creamy and decadent. The mutton with rice is tender and aromatic, a must-try. Paired with a selection of fine wine, this place promises a memorable gastronomic journey."
4,The Italian and Mediterranean restaurant inside a slow-running mall offers impressive food. A great spot if you're craving Italian and Mediterranean cuisine.
5,Tres tres bon spaghetti
5,"I enjoyed the spicy BBQ chicken pizza, penne arribiata, and creme brulee. All were very amazing dishes and would eat them all again.  The service was good but not great. The gentleman who was attending to me was very new and it showed. From my observations the rest of the service was flowing smoothly and orders were being processed efficiently. The atmosphere is of a modern italian restaurant while in a mall setting."
5,"Fantastic service, delicious food two nights on the trot after my group finished their trek. The staff were accommodating, attended us well and service was quick. For a table of 14 that's excellent.
I look forward to seeing you again."
5,"Great Food, I had the pesto Spaghetti.
Its a bit difficult to find, on the first floor of the mall. The Service personal was very friendly and helpful. I liked the dinning area, but it was a bit dark."
5,We were glad to find a good wood fired pizza and glass of wine in Kathmandu! Thanks Pravat Tamang for the great service :)
5,Excellent Pizza & Perfect Atmosphere
4,"A cute little restaurant tucked away in a mall. It's on the first floor and if you can't find it, you can easily ask around. The mint lemonade was fantastic, the best I've had in Nepal. The lemon soda was pretty good too. We had the mezze platter: hummus was nice and smooth, pita great, tzatziki so-so. The tabouleh was awesomely fresh and tasty. We also had the Nepalitana pizza which was pretty good, the dough had a nice flavor. The ambience was very welcoming and charming and the service was great."
5,Located on floor 1 in the Chhaya Center. Great oven fired pizza. Great service.
5,"I ordered the Bolognese pasta chicken, it was  a little bit salty for me but still delicious, as the flavouring was on point. Service and ambience was great! will come back again!"

bt too bad the other desserts were only available at season time"
5,"Awesome food, great service"
5,"recently had the opportunity to dine at MarcoPolo restaurant in Thamel, Kathmandu, and I must say that it was a delightful experience. From the moment I entered, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a cozy ambiance that set the tone for a pleasant evening.

The restaurant's decor was tastefully done, combining traditional and contemporary elements, creating a charming and inviting atmosphere. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and the overall layout of the restaurant provided a sense of privacy while still maintaining an open feel."
3,good food
5,Best pizza: juicy and yummy
5,"Soooo good after trekking. We ordered a pizza, sandwhich, the antipasta platter, and some chicken kabobs because we were starving after EBC. We had Rajesh as our server and he was very attentive and awesome service!"
5,"If you are looking for a cozy Italian restaurant with authentic flavors and a friendly atmosphere, look no further than ""Marco Polo "" in the heart of downtown.

Walking into the restaurant, you are greeted with warm, Tuscan-style decor and a welcoming vibe. The menu offers an array of classic Italian dishes, including antipasti, pasta, amazing pizza, and meat dishes, all made with fresh, high-quality ingredients.

My personal favorites include their Margherita pizza, which is thin and crispy with a perfect amount of cheese and tomato sauce, and their homemade Carbonara , which is rich and super tasty, with fresh eggs cheese and delicious bacon.

To complement the food, the wine list is extensive and reasonably priced, offering many Italian and international options. The staff is also very knowledgeable about wine pairings and happy to assist with any questions.

Overall, ""Marco Polo"" is a fantastic Italian restaurant that delivers delicious food and excellent service. Whether you are looking for a romantic dinner out or a casual night with friends, this restaurant is sure to please. Highly recommended.
And btw... I'm Italian so I have pretty high standards when we talk about food ;)"
5,Pizza and mustang aaloo are very tasty. Especially pizza was tasty in ingrdients

5,Best restaurant in town by a long shot!
4,"Beautiful modern interior, good food, excellent staff"
5,"Very nice place, quit European experience, I would definitively recommend."
4,"Great Italian food in Kathmandu Nepal,  must visit there with friends and family."
5,The pizza really tastes good here.
2,"Service is very poor,  I have to remind after every 10 min. Almost after 50mins I got my Buff steam momo. I don't recommend.

The only good thing about this restaurant is they have their own parking lot that's it"
2,"Went there with high expectations but overall taste and experience was okayish. Ordered keema noodles, dry laphing and momo. Momo was too garlicky. Other were average as well. Just my personal opinion "
1,"We asked the waiter to pack extra food and they came with a polythene bag, a rubber band and asked to pack us ourselves. Said, they don't give packing boxes.and they were rude. I've summarized the long story.

I don't recommend this place unless they correct their hospitality."
1,Stupid restaurant with stupid crazy food
1,"A cockroach walked right in our table while we were waiting for food. The service staff saw us seeing it and said nothing, did nothing lol. I think we were in table 4, 11th august around 4:30/5 pm."
2,"Service staff Mon payna sabai ,bal nadini,foods okay not that much cool staff Lai chai yeso guest koaagfai kasto behave garenu parxah teyo sicknu parni rexah"
4,"First lets discuss some positive aspects:
1)food was amazing
2) one of the best keema noodles in ktm
3) chicken momo was delicious
4) enough parking
5) polite and friendly staff
Negative:
1) long wait for food
2) sitting place was hot
3) order was not completed"
2,Overrated place for laphing! I have tasted a lot better laphing than this.
2,"Only food is awesome 
Place is cozy and crowded 
Due to crowd u get for order late i.e nearly 1 hour..
But momo is awesome and juiciest 

2nd review...
Taste has been drastically downgraded 

3rd review
Now the size of momo and portion of keema noodles have been drastically decreased 

Sorry not visiting now 

Wait wait wait.. Recent visit 6th Aug 2025..
Size of Momo return to old original big size 
But keema noodles still need to improve."
4,"This place is okay to visit if you are around this area.
Ordered Moxed Laphing and Dry Keema Noodles and those were average. I've had better ones on many other places. Their service is nice and the staff are really friendly. Recommended if you want to try laphing and keema noodles."
3,This place is always packed. This time we tried the chicken and buff keema noodles perfect sauce-to-noodle ratio with no sogginess. The noodles themselves weren't anything unique but tasted really good. The only thing that could use some improvement is the chili oil.
3,Food is not as good compared to past.
3,"The new thin noodles are a no no. I suggest change it back to the thick ones.

The amount of keema is also very low, its almost like theres no meat."
3,It's very crowded. Food here is always hit or miss
3,"Wanted to try this place for a very long time because of the hype and influencer marketing and finally got to it recently.

We just ordered half plate chicken keema noodles and mixed dry laphing as we had several other places to visit. The keema noodles was good and felt fresh. Laphing I have tried better. We just paid 260 Nrs. For this which is very reasonable.

As for the seating area, since they are popular, They have expanded their space to two separate areas in opposite lane."
3,"This place was great when it opened, just had the lafing, quality has gone down."
1,Not good food as hyped

1,Terrible food
4,"Momo is super delicious, while the keema noodles is good. Parking is convenient, and the ambience is decent. It's best to visit before 8 PM, as the momo and keema noodles are often sold out by then."
5,"It's always a crowded spot, but totally worth it.The laphing there is hands down the best I've ever had. The kima noodles are also incredibly tasty. As for the momo, the size is slightly larger than usual, and while the flavor is mild possibly because they use homemade spices. It really grows on you. You might not love it at first bite, but it's one of those things that gets better every time. I've been there more than 15 times, and I just keep going back."
4,"The restaurant serves tasty keema noodles, but thicker noodles would make them even better. The momos are delicious and definitely worth trying. Overall, a good spot for flavorful bites!"
1,Horrible taste wanna vomit  momo taste like onion kemma bloggers la vaneko was right food was horrible
4,"Keema noodles, momo, and laphing were all delicious. The service could use a bit of improvement, but overall, great food!"

2,"I had visited this place for laphing and keema noodles. Laphing is ok but keema noodles is worst. My friends also don't like it. It is like packet noodles. Also after 10 min of waiting at seat I myself go to counter to give order then they tell have a seat we will take your order on the table, but still they didn't come and after 6-7 min I have to call them second time. This isy second time at this place before It was good really good but now I have really bad experience."

1,"Has to be one of the worst experience. Worst customer service and worst taste .
Not recommended at all"
1,Torpe place. Keema noodle ma current halera dincha pakhe haru
1,Very namitho food not reconmended
1,Staffs were really rude
1,Worst restaurant in whole Nepal please never visit here they serve dirty food 
1,"good looking 'under-seasoned food'.
the crowd was promising, the service was nice,the interior was wonderful but unfortunately the main element-food lacked salt n spices. We ordered Laphing & momo. The extra salt saved the chips laphing but 'no amount of extra spices can save a bad momo'-the magic is in the filling. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day for the chef but there's no excuse for underperforming. U either turn up 100% or u take a break. The management should seriously consider having a good chef who knows the balance of something so basic-salt n spices."
2,"Personally didn't like the food like I used to enjoy, ordered keema noodles but instead of using proper noodles which is supposed to use for keema noodles isn't being used instead I more felt like eating local chowmein , had one bite and i was done with it and the staff can learn how to interact with customer and how to response instead of being silent"
1,"Worst place ever. I'm very disappointed with my recent order. We specifically asked for vegetarian momos, but were given chicken instead. This is a serious issue, especially for those with dietary restrictions. Please be more careful with orders in the future."
4,One of the best spicy keema noodles in town but have to wait about 20 min for your order.the atmosphere is also pretty cool and don't get worry about parking space......
4,"Hands down best keema noodles in town, the momo is average but the keema noodles here is very flavourful."
1,Not my thing
3,"Personally, I felt like the cold and hot spicy noodles at the Boudha area restaurant aren't as good as they used to be. The taste seems to have changed and doesn't have the same flavor or appeal that I enjoyed before. It's a bit disappointing compared to my earlier visits."
1,Don't know why such hype for this place but really don't live up to the  expectations. As I was passing by and got here after seeing the hype but the noodles were totally overcooked with a low quantity of minced meat also the taste was as poor as the food quantity was less itself ...never had any worse experience than this. Won't be coming here again that's for sure ....
4,"The food was an absolute delight! Every bite was bursting with flavor, perfectly balanced spices, and fresh ingredients. From the aroma to the presentation, everything felt thoughtfully prepared. The service was warm and welcoming, making the whole experience even better.

Whether you're a foodie or just hungry, this place is worth every visit. Highly recommended!"
5,Best momo in boudha
5,Amazing drinks and service by the staff especially Moe & Netra. They were diligent and made drinks meticulously.
5,"I had such a great time at this bar! The atmosphere was lively yet welcoming, and the service was outstanding. Our bartender, Mo, really made the experience special. If you're looking for a spot with great drinks and even better service, definitely ask for Mo -- he'll take care of you!"
3,"It's one of the cocktail bar in Kathmandu. They serve various types of cocktails, it is must go place for cocktail lovers . But for me who prefer beer it's not the place to be. As they have not much choice of it . But the ambience and food are perfect. Overall a cool place to spend with the mates with various cocktails."
4,"Had higher expectations for the cocktails. They were just good enough. Asked the bartender for a umami taste cocktail, he made me one off the menu that was VERY good"
5,Such a pretty place and the food was soo goodd!!! Beautiful ambience and perfect service!!!
5,"absolutely worth it.
Totally diffent vibe from Thamel street but still chillin'
Decent cocktail and servie +ambiance. Y'all should try mona's choice"
5,Great cocktails. Innovative and passionate team!
5,"Nice bar, good drinks, efficient price, staffs were friendly and comfortable, will come back for sure."
5,"One of the best cocktails bar in this town
Staffs are realy friendly.
Everyone need to try customized drinks of bartenders and negroni sour
And I want to recommend to everyone please don't missed to try buff slider"
5,"At first the ambiance was too too too good and I like the plantation of that place and there was too many signatures cocktail of their bar but I like the negroni sour that was the recommendation of bartender and it was well balanced and the shrimp skewers was also good with my drinks 
Thanks for the good recommendation of drinks as well as food too"
5,Amazing cocktail and amazing staffs! Bartender Suwarna made me a special cocktail that I'd like and it was one of the best cocktails I ever had. Deserves more people visiting and trying their special cocktail and atmosphere is great too! Will come back 100%. What a jem in Nepal bar scene!
5,"As a Londoner, I'm so sad that my favourite cocktail bar is all the way in KTM  Every drink was a hit thanks to the staff's spot-on recommendations. Rovin dai and his team were wonderful hosts - trust them to help you find your new favourite drink!"
5,"Very nice bar, very creative cocktails. Worth the visit!!!"
5,A friend brought me here and I can say the ambiance is really good especially if you prefer personal conversations- without a loud music. They have good cocktails!
5,"The atmosphere  I walked into was like nowhere, the ambience, music, bar. I was approached, served and the cocktails was of absolute brilliance. I'd like to Thank Suwarnam the bar manager and Netraw the bartender for a fantastic service and cocktails. Just amazing "
5,Great cocktails and staff were impressive dealing with incredibly rude customers.
5,Just had 3 yummy cocktails at this bar! The staff were well informed on the menu and were helpful and friendly. The drinks were of very generous size and well worth the cost! I'd happily return and recommend this place to anyone interested in well executed cocktails!
5,Best bar for cocktails enthusiast
5,"(Negroni and Boulevardier)so far the best I had in town  . ""Shisha"" is a top notch.

Staffs are polite and professional.
Ambience 
Hospitality 
Food&Drinks"
5,Best bar in Kathmandu. All time favorite Eastside
5,"Bitters and Co. is an absolute gem. The ambiance is immaculate, effortlessly setting the mood for a memorable evening. Their drinks are nothing short of spectacular, crafted with precision and bursting with flavor. The staff are exceptionally well-trained, striking the perfect balance between professionalism and warmth. Highly recommended!"
5,"The ambience here is just amazing! The cocktails,food everything is outstanding! Staffs here are well behaved and perfectly dressed! Honourable mention:- Sauron Basnet add some extra spice to our visit to bitters & co. Thank you saurav for your great hospitality! Keep up the good work"
5,"If you're looking for a top-notch cocktail experience, Bitters & Co. is an absolute must-visit. From the moment you step inside, the ambiance sets the perfect mood--dim lighting, plush seating, and a relaxed yet sophisticated vibe. The bartenders here are true artists; they know their craft and are always willing to suggest something new based on your taste preferences.

What really sets Bitters & Co. apart is the attention to detail. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, always making you feel right at home, whether you're a regular or a first-time guest. There's also a curated selection of small plates, perfect for pairing with your drinks.

Overall, it's the kind of place where you can easily spend hours unwinding with friends or enjoying a quiet evening solo. Highly recommend checking it out if you're in town!

Always looking forward to a great time at Bitters & Co. "
1,"We went there last week with friends where there was Nepalese renowned band 'The Elements', and the funny thing is we were the only customer there then we requested to play their song out of their respect.  But unfortunately we didn't know they don't care about Nepalese aritst and their creation. They don't respect Nepalese artists then we knew. We have been to many bars and places they respect customer choices depending on their own policies. This is one of the worst places where I have been and regret being there. Nothing good at all. No vibe no respect no customer service. Waste of money. Big no for all"
5,"Bitters and Co is my favorite bar in Kathmandu! Amazing cocktails, cozy vibes. Don't miss the Goal Digger -- it's perfection in a glass. Plus, Doja the cat makes every visit unforgettable! Highly recommended!"
1,"One of the worst place I've ever been. They don't inspire Nepalese artist even the artist is there. They don't respect Nepalese artist, they just care about money. As heard it's empty almost every day and even today Place was entirely empty we were the only customer there but they failed so bad with their customer service. It's dead no vibe at all.  Never go there."
5,Always a great time at Bitters & Co with Rabin & Mona. One of the best bars in K- town. Buff sliders are just so delicious 
5,"Went here based on the reviews. However I was not sure as some seemed to be fake. Went anyways. What we liked are the drinks. They were really good, but pricey. Nothing for a local Newari. The food was rather cheap but good. We liked the bread with cheese and the loaded fries. The service was attentive. What we did not like that you can smoke anywhere and that the ac is blowing the smoke through the room."
5,"Great service,yummy food and cocktails .
If you're unsure in ordering, let the bartender know your preferences and them do their magic for ya."
5,"This was my second time visiting Bitters & Co, and once again I was thoroughly impressed. My brother first introduced me to this place and from the service to the drink everything was spot-on. I decided to stick with the same drink I had the first time a Negroni sour and it was just as fantastic as I remembered. Overall a great experience and I have my brother to thank for bringing me back to this gem!"
4,"A fantastic cocktail bar with a ceiling as high as 2 floors, and with a tree bang in the centre of the bar.
Whether the bar was constructed around the tree or they decided to grow one in the middle of the bar is something I don't know, but it really added to the aesthetic.
The drinks were fantastic
The food portions were good too. The mozzarella sticks I wouldn't order again. The gochujang fries were great.
A must visit when in the city"
5,"Bitters & Co. is an absolute masterpiece of a cocktail bar.   No need for a menu--just share your mood, and the bartenders will craft a custom drink like magic. It's like they have a drink menu for your soul!

The vibe is effortlessly cool, perfect year-round, and the hosts? They're the kind of amazing that makes you want to stay for ""just one more"" (and you probably will!).

Every sip, every visit, every moment here is an experience worth savoring! Thank you!"
5,"I arrived late on a Monday night.  The hospitality the staff and manager showed was amazing.  The bartender created specialty cocktails based on what I said I liked, which were a take on a negroni and a (lavender) martini.  The interior is gorgeous, with date night vibes.  A must-go if you are in Lazimpat (excuse the spelling!)"
5,"Best venue in Kathmandu for cocktails. Staff were kind, friendly and professional.Beautiful ambience and amazing decoration."
5,"Amazing cocktails
Music soo good"
1,"Worst Service Ever. We waited 1 whole hour to get one drink and even when that wasn't done, we ordered shots instead. But even that took almost an hour so we just had to cancel the whole order. There were barely any people inside the bar and still the service was so slow. Truly disappointed by a bar that is supposed to be one of the best in KTM. Would give 0 stars if possible. "
5,"What a lovely cocktail bar! Delicious cocktails and yummy snacks. Service was excellent, with great recommendations. The highlight for me though was a super friendly cat, Doja, who came and cuddled and hung out with me the whole time, eventually going to sleep curdled up against me."
5,Bar that makes you drinks which are very worth it.
5,"Bitters & Co is a gem for espresso martini enthusiasts, serving what could easily be the best in town. Their commitment to quality is evident as they use 100% organic coffee from Nuwa Estate, ensuring each sip is as pure as it is delightful. The international coffee delegation left impressed, a testament to Bitters&Co's exceptional offerings. If you're seeking a top-notch coffee cocktail experience, this is the place to be!"
5,"Excellent service from the head mixologist, they really took a good care of us. Try their negroni, sour or regular, and for sure you'll really enjoy it. Extensive menu with various liquor base. Don't forget to order wai wai sadeko for your snack too. Really impressed with their hospitality and their resident in hpuse cat too."
5,"I was gifted with this trip by a local guy, having his local honey shop nearby.
I bought mad honey, produced himselsoap infused essential oils. He gifted me lip balm. We had this awesome magic talk about business, life, family. He speaks perfect English. Asked to call him Everest. We couldn't stop talking so he invited me to the bar, it was very close.

We talked by midnight.

If you look for a perfect european minimalist style - this is it. For Ukrainians, if you like Loggerhead you would like this one also. Price is good for the level of this bar.

P.S. they have a cat living there. I miss my cat so much, it was please to talk to this One, asked to say hi to my old friend.

Shaman Kai"
5,Best cocktail bar in town with a super professional team.
5,one of the best bar experiences ever 
1,"Heard so much about this place. We arrived and sat patiently at the bar for a long time. No one gave us a menu, acknowledged our existence. After a while, we tried calling a server but they said they were hosting some other event and would be too busy to assist us, so we left. Also incredibly loud (that day)."
4,Peace  and just not for all  / for the special 
5,"Plenty options for cocktails.
Good drinks and Great service "
5,Exceptional atmosphere and tailored service by staffs. An amazing experience highly recommend to all!
5,"Great recommendations by waitress, Annie, and bartender, Jim.

Best drinks I've had in six months, thanks."
5,Awesome drinks and cocktails along with tasty food so well served by Anne and her co servers!! Thanks
5,"Exclusive drinks and beautifully presented. Professional and friendly staff!
If you don't see your favorite drink on the card, they will make it for you."
5,"Incredible drinks, great vibes, wonderful music, fantastic feline kept us company, Queen Doja"
5,Great experience!
5,"Great drinks, nice atmosphere and super friendly staff."
5,Very friendly environment.Good Cocktails in town. All thanks to #Anniee for good Hospitality Service and she always take care of each and every customer. Best wishes Anniee for your future
5,Super beautiful spot with a nice collection of tropical plants and a cat named Dosa.  Cocktails are fire (ask for Mandil's Spicy Paloma) and the service is great. You're welcome for the tip.
5,We really enjoyed coming to Bitters and Co ! The drinks were great !! The food was delightful. Loved the music too.
1,"Worst experience ever in my life...
I just went there to have momo....
Momo it was average(personal taste )
And service ...it was worst ever i faced in my life...
Table service was just feeling like to fight with that service crew...just 
Need to learn how to serve and how to behave with customers....(specially for a person served me in worst way.)"
4,Nice
3,Test wise good but the quality is very poor
3,"Good chutney, bad momos(not juicy as expected)"
5,Best momo I ever tasted
4,In particular the buff momo tastes best here!
4,"Sandar momo is one of the finest place to eat momo.  It is distributed all over the different places of Kathmandu city.

Since it is mostly located in crowded areas like Sankhamul, etc so the place is moslty crowded.

The momo was and is still the best so far compare to other places. The pickle bottle(jhol ko bottle) is by far the best that I have experienced.

If you are in Kathmandu city then you must try this for once."
4,Taste is descent.
3,"The buff. momo is good , the food to arrive at table : waiting time is high , highly packed in rush hour, .
P. S. Very hot atmosphere inside"
5,"Best momo. Flavorful.
Quick service despite being too crowded.
You have to pay first before placing the order."
5,"Was much better than expected, slightly bigger in size than other normal"
4,Crowded in most days. Best momo among all the locations
5,Very nice teste ani service is fast
1,"I have to ask them to add jhol EVERY SINGLE TIME. Why are they so stingy with it? When you eat there, they offer as much jhol as you want but when it comes to takeaway, they barely add any, even when you specifically ask for it.  Today was like the 10th time this happened. That's very disappointing.
Sandhar is known for its jhol, so what's the point if you can't even give your customers a decent amount when they request it? After today, I'm not going back. This was the worst experience."
5,"Best Place, Delicious momo"
1,"Today my friends and I went to saandaar for the first time , but our experience doesn't match our expectations. Chicken momo was not good so far. I think this is my first and last journey to saandaar."
5,The food was delicious 
1,Worst momo i ever had.I never recommend to visit it. thank u
5,Best
3,"Momos not good as they used to be. Taste is getting bad, did you recently changed the momo maker or what? Waiting time still bad."
3,Losing its quality
5,"The food tastes amazing, especially the buff momo--fast, flavorful, and in high demand. The goat momo is pricier and takes longer, but absolutely worth it. Their jhol is out of this world.

However, the place gets very crowded. Even with many staff, it's chaotic during peak hours. We couldn't find a seat. The coupon system makes it feel disorganized--it's not first-come, first-served.

People still go for the experience, and the food lives up to the hype."
4,It's all about franchises but in other locations it may be good
3,Ok ok
5,The restaurant cafe de patan was really nice the staffs and the service were really good the food was amazing and especially the manager Mr Nischal Shakya ji he is really just bravo
5,"Service: RESTAURANT
They have very good CONE PIZZA."
5,"During my visit to Nepal in early 2025, I stopped by Cafe de Patan, a small family-run restaurant in the heart of Patan's old city. The atmosphere was quiet and authentic, surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of the area.

The family running the cafe was warm and welcoming. I tried Chatamari for the first time--simple, traditional, and full of local flavor. Sitting on the rooftop afterward, I enjoyed a peaceful view of Patan's historic skyline.

This cafe isn't fancy, but it carries a quiet charm that reflects the soul of the city. A lovely place to pause and feel connected."
1,"The view is excellent over the city. The service is good but the food is average. The coffee is not that great for Nepal.

Music was too loud and heavy on the bass. Who plays that kind of music in the morning? Felt like I was being repeatedly kicked in the ears."
5,Great Experience
5,Good food Good Ambience..near Patan Durbar square..ginger buff the must try dish here..
3,Quite refresh experience with hot coffee.
5,One of best places in Patan to try authentic Newari food. The place was chosen by my colleague to introduce local food to a group of our clients this morning and I should say that was a great decision. The servers were also really hospitable and accommodating. Definitely recommend.
5,Food was good and ajay vaiko service was osm ..we'd love to visit again ..thankyou ajay!!
5,"The staff were incredibly warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming, making the whole experience feel personal and relaxed. The attached cafe also served delicious food and coffee, making it a great spot to unwind.

If you're looking for a quiet, authentic, and beautifully maintained place to stay in Patan, I highly recommend Cafe de Patan. I'll definitely return!"
5,"I went three times and probably I will go again. Delicious food, beautiful courtyard, kind people."
2,The food was okay. Tried their buff choila; the meat was very hard. The Chinese Chopsuey had no flavour. The Fish Sizzler was salty.
2,Ordered full breakfast. The juice is also taste cheap and the salad the cucumber was so bad that my mouth taste gone whole wrong.
1,"A pleasant location, but the service is subpar. The server wasn't attentive, had to ask for the same thing multiple times, yet he kept on forgetting. And once the food was brought, that was it, no check backs, nothing. We said we'd order mains as we only ordered sides but there was no one to be seen.
And the food was utterly awful, we ordered cheeseballs, it was fine but it came with a mayo, which wasn't best of quality. And the boneless chicken chilly was shameful, it was undercooked, batter was burnt, and not even mixed with the chilly sauce, it actually didn't have any chilly sauce. Didn't even ordered mains after that. And even the coke came in a plastic glass."
4,"The food was quite ok (good momo, fine pancake dishes, ppor chicken drumsticks), service is a bit slow,but friendly."
5,good place good food
4,"Cafe de Patan is a charming restaurant located close to the heart of Patan Durbar Square (Yela Lyaku). The ambience is a perfect blend of traditional Newa culture and modern dining setup, making it a unique spot for both locals and visitors. The restaurant beautifully incorporates Newa architecture, with intricate woodwork and heritage-inspired decor, giving you the feeling of being immersed in history while enjoying a great meal.

The food here is authentic and fantastic, with a variety of traditional Newa dishes that you shouldn't miss. Some of the highlights include the cone pizza, buff and chicken ginger with baji set, and the Newa platter, which offers a delightful mix of flavors. Other must-try items include momo, soups, burgers, bara (woo), and chattamari, all prepared with great attention to taste and authenticity. They also have a good selection of coffee and alcoholic beverages, making it a great place for a relaxed meal or an evening hangout.

If you're looking for a place to experience traditional Newa cuisine, Cafe de Patan is the place to be. For two-wheelers, parking is convenient, but if you're driving a four-wheeler, you'll need to park at the Durbar Square parking lot. Payments are easy with QR and card payment options available. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to enjoy great food in a cultural setting!"
4,"Quiet place, quick service and good ambience"
5,"Great milk coffee, attentive service, and nice ambiance."
1,"Saw a rat popping out of our table cushion and ran on the floor.
Wifi does not operate in certain areas of the cafe
Food is unnecessarily expensive
The waiter with glasses on has no hospitality manners zero interest in explaining delicacies"
5,"The food is extraordinary, fresh and delicious. Friendly staff and pleasant vibes."
4,Best place for yummy signature dishes like ginger buff garlic chicken sukuti  cone pizza yummy yummy very yummy..not changed at all till today
3,"Recently I went with my family, orderd fried buff momo, chicken momo fries and some fresh drinks. Everything was fine but the fried buff momo was kind a sour(amilo). At that time coz i was very hungry i ate really quick. But the next day i really felt upset on my tummy. I dont know what to say but i have tried lots and lots of buff momo and have not had sour taste is it the spices or the momo was kept for a while. I ll never go there anymore"
5,Khana haru sabai ramro xa. Thau Pani ekdam ramro.
4,"Mix Cone pizza was so so yummy, boasting a rich flavor and super duper cheesy. Jhol momo was also good in taste. Friendly staff , plenty of seats to sit and service was also good. "
5,Do visit
5,I went these twice. Both times the service was excellent. Liked the fish in the fish set menu.
4,"Pizza rolls good! Me and my fiance loved it, the portion is just right for a person and has a smooth texture."
5,"Update: came back after 2 years, and the food is AMAZING. The jhol momo is just full of flavor and the jhol has right taste of peanut and other spices. There are different level of spices available for choyela and both the spices are well balanced. The serving dish also screams traditional. Highly recommended!!

The ambience - beautiful. Aesthetic - traditional yet cozy. Staff - kind and polite. Food was however okayish only. Cheese ball was cold when brought so no cheesy at all, chicken chilly was well just spicy, felt that the pizza cone is hyped only. Ordered iced cappuccino , they brought it by adding sugar already. Was disappointed.
Hopefully just a bad day."
5,Quiet place with great food and excellent customer service.
4,"Well, you'll get parking space if you get there. I had pizza, which was visually impaired appealing too and also the taste was good.

The thing which can be improved is momo achar, it is a bit weird kind of."
5,"Overall, The ambience was solid the food was top notch and delicious. The server Ajay was really nice and helpful. Even the price was very justified as per the taste and quality. A very good place in Patan to go with your family."
5,Jedzenie bardzo dobre mila obsluga klimat w jaki zrobiona jest restauracja bardzo przyjemny
5,Great restaurant! Very friendly stuff and nice calm terrace inside.
5,"Visited twice, and wasn't disappointed
The place was clean, the food was tasty, the service was good and the reasonable prices"
3,Very close to Patan Durbar Square. We tried veg momos and we didn't like it. Spacious place with not so great decore. Service was quick.
5,"Wonderful experience 
The employees and stay was amazing.
The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and very accommodating.
I would highly recommend coming to stay here. "
5,"We held a birthday party. The food was great, service was fast. And prices are reasonable. "
5,Perfect place to spend tym in friendly environment..suitable price as well as good food 
5,Lovely restored building. We had a very good Thali.
5,"Excellent pizza and service, peaceful and close to PatanDurbar."
5,"Cafe de Patan is perfectly situated, just a short walk to Patan Durbar Square and nearby shops. The diverse menu offers a wide selection of Newari and Italian dishes, along with imported wines. Delicious dessert options, though the pizza was a bit greasy. The traditional and beautiful interior adds to the interesting dining experience. Recommended for a taste of local and international flavors!"
3,"Located in the centre of Mangal bazaar ,Patan ...a lovely restaurant . Can be a little crowded with the  locals  in  the evenings but in the day ;you could have the whole place for yourself . Nice place to chill out alone or with friends ..try their , Sukuti Sandeko and Jhol momo which  is both pleasing and delightful ."
3,Nice place
5,Yizha nevariv vrazhaie. Berit momo y kurku
3,"Its a pity....The  BEST location in Patan, beautiful old charming house, wonderful staff, 3rd generation family owner who proudly wants to continue running the place, good reputation and mentioned in all guide books etc etc.....
But the truth is - the place really needs a proper renovation...its old old old.
And even old would be okey if you would take care of the place.
Wash all the windows, clean and varnish all the furniture, change the old curtains to new ones, make sure the bedlinen is clean and not full of stains, make the waterheater/hot shower work please, scrub all the tiles in the bathrooms, change the carpets....take out all the dust from everywhere..These are all small things that can be made cheaply with only manpower, no need to spend tons of money.
This wonderful place needs a proper facelift, back to its past glory !!!
It got all the potential.
Owners are really really nice people with good english and communication."
5,Best In the town.
2,Quality and Quantity degradated
5,food service and ambiance was good. food was not too expensive. highly recommended
5,"Nice restaurant. The food is good.
I'd recommend the Pan Fried Gnocchis with Oyster Mushrooms which were absolutely delicious but unfortunately the portion was really small."
5,"Lugar super agradavel, musica baixa, bom pra descansar do agito da cidade. Otima comida, muitas opcoes e excelente atendimento. Recomendo!"
5,"Amazing food, nice attention and comfortable place"
5,"Fabuleuse adresse!
La cuisine est vraiment originale et recherchee. On est agreablement surpris par le melange des saveurs. Le cadre est calme et reposant! C'est un restaurant qui sort de l'ordinaire"
5,Nice vegetarian restaurant. Look for the second floor
5,"I love Places! I have been coming here for about 9 years now. The fresh juices are always so good, proper coffee, and the veggie meals don't disappoint. The meditation bowl with falafel and fresh veg was SO necessary and restorative after weeks of trekking food. Delicious. It's also on the second floor (quiet), so it's good for bringing a laptop and working or spending a few hours just lounging about talking. Definitely recommend!"
5,Very delicious and great service! Highly recommend!
5,"Great place to work from if you're okay with sitting on the floor, big smoothie bowls tasty food"
5,"Absolutely perfect!
Absolument parfait ! Tres bon plat et tres bon service .
Me encanto! Todo delicioso y un servicio excelente. Totalmente recomendable !"
5,"Ich kann dieses Restaurant sehr empfehlen, das Essen ist frisch und authentisch lecker. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet und man hat einen schonen Blick auf die belebte Strasse."
5,Service was wonderful and the food fantastic! I was so happy to find a high quality restaurant accommodating vegans. The personnel was super friendly and the food fantastic!
5,"Very good food and service. The prices are reasonnable comparing to other restaurants. I had the special pizza, very good."
4,"Tasty food, generous portions but pity about the slow service."
5,It's a very nice location for a delicious drink or good vegetarian/vegan food. The ambience is very cosy and the staff were super nice. I would go there again when I'm back in Kathmandu!
5,"I visit this place every time I'm in Kathmandu, it's one of my favourites in the city. The whole menu is vegetarian and there are a lot of vegan options as well. The restaurant offers classic nepali food as well as western dishes. The overall vibe of the place is cozy and the drinks are delicious!"
5,Fuimos dos veces a cenar y excelente todo!! Carta amplia con muchas opciones.  Un lugar relajado para cenar tranquilamente 
5,Delicious food and amazing service!
5,"Amazing place, came for dinner 3 times! It was so good, all the food is so yummy! My fave dish was the chilli chips and the nepali thali. The owner is lovely too, thanks Pradeep for your hospitality !"
5,We were the only customers as the place livens up during tea and dinner but we enjoyed the food and drinks nonetheless. The crispy corn and turmeric lattes were a treat! You need to look for the entrance which is up a flight of stairs and I love the view from the large windows. Be prepared to remove your shoes if you prefer the traditional seats.
5,The owner is amazing!
5,"Super chill vibes & fresh, tasty food. I was skeptical of eating veggies throughout my travels in Nepal & India but I gave in here & felt totally fine. The staff was friendly & helpful. I got the Mediterranean bowl & it was great!"
5,We had a great meal at Places Restaurant. The Buddha bowl is filling and delicious. Would definitely recommend!
5,The most perfect restaurant. Amazing food and vibe. Amazing owner and great view over the street. Moussaka is delicious
5,"Delicious food and the most friendly owner. Such a nice and cozy place. Would definitely go again. Thanks for inviting us!

Musssst Visit"
5,"I LOVE PLACES!
We went for dinner and their food was amazing.
Service was great!
We came for breakfast the next morning
Their breakfast deal is incredible
You can have any item from their breakfast menu and it comes with a juice and coffee!
Such a great deal!

I love the vibe of the place,
Floor seating and shoes off kinda vibe 

Can't wait to keep coming back here whilst in Kathmandu 

100% recommend!"
5,Tasty meals and friendly staff
5,I felt very happy when I reached there. I had lunch at this restaurant for 850 rupees. The lunch was very delicious. The ambiance of this restaurant was very good. It was eco friendly. It was very good to go and eat with family.
5,"Very cute location, and huge portions of delicious food!"
5,"Nice location, in the heart of the city, lively atmosphere and great service, good quality vegetarian cuisine and also the presentation of the dishes are excellent. I recommend a visit without a doubt"
5,"Det bedste sted i hele Nepal. Uanset hvad du bestiller er det vanvittigt laekkert, og det er et sted hvor der er plads til alle og helt vildt rart."
5,"Lovely place to have dinner, carrot and spinach soups are really good as well as their gnocchi :)"
2,"Ordered a coconut chickpea curry and received some sort of sugary tomato soup.

My friend's pesto momos were the worst momos we had tried in Nepal, completely lacking in flavour.

Only good things were the cosy seating and the yogi juice packed a strong tasty punch.

Overall disappointing, flavourless food."
5,"Hicimos una pausa para tomar algo y descansar y hemos quedado encantados. Hemos consumido bebidas y un helado frito. El ambiente del lugar es muy bueno y el servicio es excelente. Sin duda, volveremos para probar algo mas del menu"
5,Ens va encantar el menjar. Tot bonissim!!! Increible lloc!
5,"Came here twice in one day because of how delicious it was and the service was great. Definitely try their soups, I had the pumpkin as well as the clear mushroom. I liked the mushroom more but they were both great i tried the spinach and goat cheese salad which was delicious as well and did not have too much dressing on it. Their momos are very interesting. I had the kind with chocolate. I'm not a fan of fried foods so I would probably pass on those next time but if you like fried stuff try them they are unique. My partner had a pizza and did not complain or give much hype. My meal was the gnocchi which was interesting. I am not a huge fan of gnocchi to begin with but this was tasty with the oyster mushrooms. I liked sitting on the floor and they make you take your shoes off :) definitely give this place a try and you won't be disappointed!"
5,"Great dinner spot with comfy floor seating.
The food was good quality and portions and great pricing.
The staff were friendly and attentive."
5,"Liebe alles an diesem Laden! Das ist genau mein Vibe. Super gemutlich, leckeres & gesundes Essen, sehr nettes Personal. Kann ich nur weiter empfehlen, wenn man auf eine entspannte Atmosphare steht."
1,"We spent 10 minutes within 20 meters of the restaurant, but never saw a sign or an entrance. The food might be good, but we never found the entrance."
5,Amazing vegan food and atmosphere in the heart of Thamel 
5,"Amazing tofu steak, Pad Thai and spinach paneer. Also the juices and teas were fresh and delicious "
5,"Great place! Had the momos with pumpkin filling and chocolate sauce as a treat after a hike and it was fantastic. They have tofu and it's very nice to be able to get some protein too
The dining room is lovely, good wifi, tons of comfy seating space, and the staff was very welcoming."
2,Das Essen ist mittelmassig und die Preise sind vergleichsweise teuer. Keine Ahnung was diese Suppen sein sollen. In der Nahe gibt es viele bessere Restaurants. Das Ambiente ist nett.
5,"An absolute gem in Thamel. Amazing food and drinks, service is super quick, and prices are good. Always a very cool vibe and a beautiful place to relax and meet people. 10/10 recommend stopping in whether you live in KTM or you're visiting!!"
5,"We've visiting this place for dinner the atmosphere really chill relax, the service very good , we tried to  pesto momo it's so tasty really best place to eat , we are really enjoying "
5,"Good place with nice ambiance and service.
The best momo in town"
1,"We ate here twice, the first time we came for lunch and enjoyed it so we came back the next day for dinner. However, after eating dinner here my boyfriend became very sick with food poisoning. Safe to say we will not be returning.

Hopefully by reading this review the management team can re-evaluate how their food is prepped/prepared."
5,"Have been to Places many times during my stay in Kathmandu. Great ambiance, staff is very welcoming and friendly, and the food is delicious! You have to try the new items recently added to the menu. All will leave you speechless"
5,Such a good place to go to eat. The service is good and the food also. I advise to go there
5,"It's a very nice place, pleasant and the food is delicious.  I advise to go there !"
5,"Super friendly staff, I went few times for breakfast , and dinner and It was delicious, Dhanyabaad"

5,"Great food and drinks, wonderful service"
5,"Really nice vibe, good vegetarian food, and drink deals (2-for-1 cocktails until 9 p.m.) Can sit in chairs or take your shoes off and sit on cushions. Whiskey sour and quesadillas definitely recommended."
5,Immaculate vibes! The staff is so welcoming & the happy hour deals are amazing.
5,"Amazing place to go in Thamel, happy hour is all day...2 for one!!!!! Most affordable place to drink in Kathmandu deadass. Great food, amazing staff, and great music also. Highly reccomend"
5,Great service and a really good spot for vegans!
5,"Amazing food, loved it !!!"
1,"We visited this place after seeing that it was quite highly rated. However, it would be an understatement to say that it didn't live up to the ratings. It was a total disaster. We ordered the vegetable sizzler, baby calzone and cold coffee. The restaurant was almost empty. The sizzler was poor, with no sauce and a very dry and tasteless veg patty. Cafes in my local area have better veg sizzlers than Places restaurant.

The waiter somehow ""missed"" the baby calzone order even though we had ordered only 3 items. A clear lack of training was on display. I am quite baffled as to how this restaurant is so highly rated on Google. Maybe the quality may have degraded quite a bit in a short span of time, which is quite common in Nepal and usually due to changes in the backroom staff. Avoid this place if you can."
5,Muy buenos huevos benedictinos . Un lugar limpio. Musica agradable. Altamente recomendable.
1,Fake reviews
5,Chill spot with quality foods. Will be visiting again.
4,Perfect hang out place to plan your next himalayan trek or for a post trek celebration. Good location and warm service by friendly staff.

5,"Such kind staff, huge extensive menu with so many good options that are all super good! Vibes are amazing with the music, views and seating area, plus they take card which is always a pro! I recommend the spinach and goat cheese salad a lot- they also have great drinks!"
5,Great food and people
5,"I've been eating there everyday for breakfast, lunch and dinner since I arrived in Kathmandu one week ago.

Large selection of dishes (I eat something different every time), big portions and good taste. As a tourist, prices are low.

The crew is friendly and polite.

Enjoy "
5,"Fresh food, excellent service."
5,I decided to try this place for lunch and I'm so glad that I did! The food was fresh and delicious. I ordered the Dal Bhat with garlic naan. Wow! The staff were gracious and friendly. For this place you need to find the stairs and go up one level from the street. I would come back here again.
5,Super Restaurant mit einem sehr umfangreichen Menu voller leckerer vegetarischer und Veganer Gerichte. Waren zwei mal hintereinander dort weil es so unglaublich lecker war. Bestens Restaurant in Kathmandu! Der Service ist auch super.
5,Regular Lassi for Kathmandu people's
4,"This shop has delicious lassi with dry fruits on the top. Lassi is truly refreshing and a must try drink when you visit the Makkan area. It has two sizes small (Rs. 60) and big one (Rs.110). You'll find a huge crowd here and there's no place to sit and drink. So, you have to stand outside and drink."
5,try it!
1,"We found LONG HAIR inside the Lassi just few days ago. And again, today news are coming that Blade was found inside lassi and 25000 was fined by Mahanagarpalika. SO ZERO HYGIENE AND SAFETY."
5,"Lassi $60 (small)

It tastes very creamy and delicious! That's why it's crowded with local."

5,Just as good as the reviews suggest. Go here!

2,"Lassi was watery! As it was a very hot day the lassi did quench my thirst.
To be honest below average drink."
4,"-110

They provide the take-out of plastic cups.

 But about the taste of yogurt/lassi ... I think it's just ordinary fruit-flavored yogurt......"

5,"Creamy, nutty, and with a hint of rose! This has to be one of, if not, the best lassi I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration. The secret might be that it's made from buffalo milk as opposed to cow's milk.

55 Nepali rupees for a small glass, or 100 for a tall boy."
5,Fue mi primer vaso de Lassi en nepal y sin duda ha sido el mejor
5,"It is undoubtedly one of the best lassis I have ever tried. A perfect comb of sweet & sour curd, dried fruits, chopped nuts and a hint of safforn.

It''s a must recommended if you are around Darbar Square."
1,Gai Zhuang Zhong datuta
5,"Best lassi in town, no doubts"
5,This is my go to place to have lassi in IndraChowk area
5,Best Lassi in town: 55 NPR for the small size and 100 NPR for the bigger size.
5,"Excelente lassi, es un puesto de beber y seguir tu camino, nada de sentarse,"
5,Great lassi stop !
5,"This is a a rather famous shop in Indra Chow. They just offer one thing, a delicious lassi that's not too sweet, topped with a dollop of cheesy crumble and a few nuts and raisins. You can get it small (Rs 55 in Oct 2023) or large (Rs 100). My aunt introduced me to it in 2010 and I had to pay a visit when I returned to Kathmandu in 2023. It's that memorable."
2,This used to be my favorite place for lassi in indrachowk but recently they started adding A LOT of ice to their lassi making it too runny. The khuwa also tastes bad. They changed their location from October 17th and started using plastic cups instead of their usual glass which was also kinda disappointing. The quality and authenticity of Janakpur lassi bhandar has terribly reduced.
5,"This might be the best lassi in Kathmandu! The shop is simple: they sell a small cup for 55rps or a large cup for 100rps. The lassi itself is not overly thick and is sweetened with sugar or perhaps honey. They also add in some raisins, cashews and some kind of soft pudding (only for the large cup). It's so good that I will be going back for more before I leave "
5,"Indrachowk is famous for lassi right below Aakash Bhairav. But Janakpur Lassi Bhandar, inside an alley next to the chowk, serves the lassi best in taste with enough nuts, khowa, hint of rose flavour and perfect creaminess.  At present, the roadway in the alley is disrupted and some construction work is going on. They have currently shifted to the new place which is a few meters ahead, next to Global IME Bank. There is always a man in the old shop to give you the direction of the new relocation. Overall, I would go here over and over."
4,Best lassi in the town.
5,Best Lassi in town!!!!
5,Wow #nice #mittho lssii
5,Very nice and refreshing drink!! Fresh make and not too sweet.
4,"Step aside, other lassi joints! This place is the OG trendsetter in the vicinity. They probably invented lassi before cows even knew they could produce milk! And boy, does it show in the taste! Their lassi is like a sweet, creamy dream that'll make you question your existence. Plus, they serve it in actual glasses - not those flimsy plastic cups other places use, 'cause they seem to care about the environment and your drinking experience. So, if you want a lassi that's as legendary as the disco era, head straight to this spot and let your taste buds party like it's 1980."
5,One of the best Lassi's I have ever had. There are lots of other sellers with lassi around the junction but this one tastes the best from the rest. It is priced higher at Rs 55 for small and 100 for a large glass compared to other sellers selling at Rs 45-50 for small glass. There's a hint of saffron in the lassi with dry fruits too. I always have a small glass every time I go by the area.
4,Lassi is sweet when ever I visit there i always have a glass of lassi .

4,Lassi was good and value for money. I drink it thrice when I get there first time.i hadn't drink that better lassi before. I would recommend to try it for once.
5,Amazing lassie
4,It was sweet but not like the Janakpur's lassi that you will only get in Janakpur.
5,"Best lassi, authentic taste, just love it "
4,"Good lassi with khuwa, raisins, cashew & almont topping.
Served in (reusable) glass.
Less crowded than other lassi shops around.
Large Glass - Rs 90
Small Glass - Rs 50"
4,One of my favourite place for lassi.
2,delicious 
5,"Delicious coffee (I visited every single day for four cons days, having my flat white), super friendly service from Anita, her sister and all the staff (it's a family business). They're also selling local beans (they're a roaster too) I'll buy a few kgs before leaving. Super high quality and unbeatable value for money.  recommended if you are in KTM!"
5,"Lovely place to sit, nice coffee. Banana muffin is a must-try. When we were jet lagged and confused upon arriving in Thamel this place was a real sanctuary! Paninis are also good."

2,"We visited this cafe today and found it very busy, with all tables occupied. We managed to find a seat, but the overall experience was disappointing. The staff seemed unfriendly and overwhelmed, showing little attention to service. The coffee was just okay--nothing more--and it was served lukewarm. We asked for brown sugar, which was not brought to our table; it was simply placed near the staff without informing us, and I only noticed it by chance. At one point, we accidentally spilled some water and asked for help, but no one came.

Another issue was the smoke--although smoking is allowed only at the outside tables, the smoke drifts straight inside through the open windows, making it unpleasant for those seated indoors.

The cafe is clearly understaffed for the number of guests, and management should seriously consider hiring more people, especially during peak hours. Unfortunately, I won't be returning."
5,"Best coffee in Kathmandu!! The owners are so friendly and welcoming and really care about the customers and the coffee. We had coffee here at least twice a day while staying in Kathmandu (We recommend the brownie:))

That said, don't bother ordering certain drinks if the manager is making them as even after being a loyal customer for months he'll water down your juice to bank the extra saving which is about as low as it gets..."

5,"Visited for a family gathering. Loved the atmosphere & food!
Worth mentioning is service by Sailesh ji.

Will definitely recommend."
1,"I still remember my experience which was during the nepali new year's day. Very memorable indeed because we had to dine infront of the RESTROOM. Mind you, I had made reservations 2 days prior and noted the services would be available for me(+1) at our requested time but when we arrived the staffs were just negligently placing us where ever they found soothing. I'm writing this today because I passed by that restaurant today like most times and I don't want to be haunted by the disrespectful service I received whenever I pass by."
5,"Amazing food served by sailesh,hospitality was amazing well mannered polite.Food was amazing will visit soon  Cheers to life "
5,"One of the best dine-in spots in Kathmandu. The interior is inviting, the staff are warm and welcoming, and the food is simply good and flavorful. A wonderful experience overall "
4,"The food was exceptional other than the tandoori chicken which was raw within.  Subsequently, we had ordered a few coconut water and the noise created from the lads  preparing it was annoying.  Besides this, our experience in entirety was exceptional and the service second to none"
5,"The restaurant offered a delightful experience with both great food and a warm atmosphere. The dishes were tasty, fresh, and nicely presented. What truly stood out was the hospitality by Yubaraj he was attentive, professional, and very pleasant, which made the visit even more enjoyable. Overall, a perfect combination of good food and excellent service."
3,"fancy place , a bit pricy, food lack of consistency, don't match with price and portion. Parking problem , runout many dishes"
5,Good service by sailesh...very good food
1,"Place was totally overhyped the dishes were way to dry if i am paying 600 something for chicken chilly i expect it to be juicy and boneless but it was so dry. food were salty

But if you want to go for ambience and top notch service you can go there"
5,"The best place for dine-in in and around Kathmandu. We loved the interior, service and most importantly the food was top notch. They are soo welcoming and warm. We loved it here"
5,"Food, service & vibe top not"
5,Definitely get the Truffle Chicken and Prawn A La Crevette. Service is impeccable. We had a wonderful time.
5,Tasty food with good ambience!!
5,"From the very first glance, the dishes served were a visual treat beautifully plated with vibrant colors and fresh garnishes. The grilled pieces, likely tandoori-style, were rich in smoky char and flavor, complemented perfectly by the green herb chutney base that added a refreshing contrast. A feast for both the eyes and the palate. Highly recommended for those who appreciate flavor-packed dishes with a gourmet presentation twist."
5,Heaven for Indian cuisine! Everything that we tried was amazing! Must visit!
5,"One of the best spots in town! The food was amazing, and Chef Ajay Dai was really humble and friendly to everyone."
5,The ambinance and food was brilliant and superb taste.Thanks to our Fantastic chef dai for delicious food and again thanks to the dining family for best hospitality.
5,"This sprouts that i tasted, something new, innovative. One of the best environments ever seen, best ever taste, best ever experience. Recommended for sea foods!!!"
5,"Personally, the best Indian and sea food restaurant in town. A must visit when you are in Kathmandu. Their chicken starters are amazing. Excellent service with extremely polite staff. Keep it up."
3,"Good upscale ambience, although the food wasn't particularly special. It was decent but nothing to write home about."
5,Best for Indian dishes
5,Must visit once... Amazing taste
1,Very bad food experience
5,Great food with great hospitality. Specilly thanks to Sailesh for his great hospitality and service.
5,"Food is extremely good and fresh.
The quality is very nice ."
1,Unprofessional Service.
5,"One of the Finest Dining Experiences in Kathmandu

Dining here was truly exceptional. Chef Ajay is nothing short of a magician with his culinary artistry. We asked him to choose the menu for us, and he amazed us dish after dish. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian selections were outstanding -- full of flavor, creativity, and finesse.

The ambiance, service, and attention to detail made it a complete fine dining experience. Easily one of the must-visit places in Kathmandu if you're looking to indulge in top-tier cuisine."
5,Good one
5,"BEST FOOD IN THE TOWN. MUST TRY!!!! GOOD FOOD,SERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE 10/10"
5,"Blown away by Dining room by Chef Ajay! From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance was just chef's kiss - truly setting the perfect mood. But what truly made our evening unforgettable was the spectacular hospitality; every staff member went above and beyond. The food was nothing short of magnificent. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece. A must visit place!!"
1,"We were a group of 4, and I, a lifelong vegetarian, specifically ordered veg jhol momo. After 30 minutes, the momo arrived. I took one bite, and was horrified to realize it was chicken.

We called the waiter, who casually admitted it was a mix-up. No apology, no accountability , just pure negligence. My veg momo was delivered to another table upstairs.

This is completely unacceptable, especially from a so-called reputed restaurant. For vegetarians, this isn't just a mistake,  it's offensive and traumatic. If your staff can't get basic orders right, you have no business serving food.

I'm never coming back. This ""Mixup by Ajay"" has me thinking twice before dining outdoors."
4,Tasted few items all good except biryani.
5,Such a nice place to have dinner with family and friends. The ambience is so great and the staffs are so friendly. This is a must visit if your looking to satisfy your palate with best Indian food in town.
5,Nice food and good service..
5,"Ovr, I had a pleasant and fascinating experience/vibes at Dinning Room by chef Ajays. The food was spectacular ranging from its delicate cheese balls to marvelous Indian dishes packed with tons of  flavors. Definitely a must try! "
5,"A Truly Delightful Experience at Dining Room by Chef Ajay

From the moment we stepped in, Dining Room by Chef Ajay impressed us with its warm and elegant ambience. The interior is beautifully designed -- modern yet cozy -- making it a perfect setting for a relaxed and enjoyable meal.

But what truly stood out was the food. Every dish we tried was full of flavor, cooked to perfection, and presented with care. It's clear that Chef Ajay puts his heart into every plate. The balance of spices and textures made the meal truly memorable.

Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quality dining experience with excellent service and a stunning atmosphere. Definitely coming back soon!"
1,"This one is much hyped. I have been there today , it's Monday , and the service is too poor. Basically this place is for Indian people and Indian food as far as I know but the service and the indoor sittings here is pathetic. Prices are a bit high, you cannot get whatever you wish to have.They have big menu but not all the items you choose are available.

The people who serve food are not friendly and you have to put your effort in order to get your food on time otherwise it's completely mess. Once is enough for this place. Big NO to repeat ."
1,Extremely slow service. Lack of staff.
4,A nice place with good ambience. Food is different though nice. Very conveniently located right along the road from Bhatbhateni leading to baluwatar. They have indoor as well as terrace seating. The only drawback seems to be the limited parking.
1,One of the slowest service ever I have experienced
5,"I just went to Restaurant and it was pretty good! The vibe was super chill, like you could go for a quick lunch or hang out for a while over dinner.

Not too fancy, not too casual - just right. The staff was on the ball, always there when you needed 'em but not hovering, which is nice. And the food? Solid.

Nothing that'll blow your mind, but everything tasted fresh and well-made.

Definitely felt like I got my money's worth. If you're looking for a dependable spot for a good meal, you can't really go wrong with Restaurant."
5,"THIS RESTAURANT IS OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS, THE INTERIOR IS BEAUTIFUL DESIGNED, AND THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT. A GREAT PLACE TO ENJOY A FANTASTIC DINING EXPERIENCE"
1,Never in my life ever I had to step out of a restaurant because the food was served too late. A plate of momo was all that I ordered because I was hungry and eating solo. Imagine the food not being served for almost 45 minutes and no one coming in between to check with you. They told me they mistakenly served my order to some other table. What a horrible experience I had with this restaurant.
5,Very amazing space for unique food taste with amazing ambience. I enjoyed different varieties with lovely taste. Most recommend place to visit if you are in Kathmandu and want to taste wonderful  taste. I had few amazing tastes of unique food
5,"truly lives up to its name -- it was absolutely amazing! The food was not only delicious but also fresh and well-balanced. Each dish had a rich, authentic taste that left a lasting impression.

The service was even more impressive -- the staff were friendly, attentive, and genuinely warm. Their respectful behavior and prompt service made the dining experience even more enjoyable..."
5,"Had a great time at harding`s last time went there for a small  nerworking event fof 20 and thay were very accmmodating .it was perfect .huge thank you to yubraj the rest of the staff .I highly recmmend harding""s for your next get tougehter."
5,Evert aspect of our stay exceeded our expectations.great staff most comfortable table ever amazing location.bar makes amazing martinis and restaurant makes a lovely food .
1,Very bad service
1,Very poor service. The waiter does not come to check on you while you're having food
1,Very poor service
3,"Went with family of 8, for my birthday dinner and was very excited for it since I'd heard such good things. The food was good, it didn't feel overly oily or over spiced like most Indian restaurants in Kathmandu. However, the service of the restaurant wasn't to my liking. The waiters lacked warmth and a welcoming attitude. One waitress (probably her name is Jeny) literally snatched the plate from my hands. I understand that after whole day of work, it can be frustrating but last thing you want to do is be rude to your customers. The restaurant got really busy an hour after our arrival so I get it but, the facility lacked the ability to manage the orders. Everything arrived super late. The food was good and lived up to the expectation, however, Chef Ajay should really look into the management. Its not only the taste but the experience that people leave your restaurant with."
3,Food was good service was good but space & hookah wasn't good. Its too hot outside as its way too open
5,"Excellent food and drinks; loved the biryani, naan and chicken masala. Who knew brocolli could taste that good, a must have appetiser.
Service delivery does need improvement."
5,Yummy food and pleasant atmosphere with excellent service.
5,Ambience was good and service is excellent also food was tooooo good 
5,"Visit again every things is amazing
Everyone visit once in a life"
1,"Firstly, parking presents a significant challenge.  The prawn dish lacked lemon, the sizzler was missing its sauce, and the mutton momo was spoiled.  Furthermore, the waiter prematurely removed the momo sauce."
5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Dining Room By Chef Ajay, and I must say it was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a cozy ambiance that immediately made me feel at home.

The menu boasted an impressive variety of dishes, each one thoughtfully crafted. I opted for Chicken Tikka and Prawn chilly, and every bite was an explosion of flavor. The freshness of the ingredients and the attention to detail in presentation truly stood out. It's evident that the chefs take immense pride in their work.

The service was impeccable--attentive without being intrusive, and the staff went out of their way to ensure every aspect of our meal was perfect.

Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply looking for a place to unwind with exceptional food, Dining Room is the place to be. I will definitely be returning and recommending it to everyone I know!"
5,"Known Chef Ajay for some few years ... Awesome chef , His Indian food preps are all really good. Recently visited his new restaurant. The ambience was really nice.. Comfortable seats and the decor was very nice ..High ceilings, well stocked and decorated bar...open kitchen. The staff were very professional. Toilets were very clean and loved the separate hand washing areas... We had variety of snacks which were lip smacking good and for mains we had mutton and butter chicken and Dal makhani with garlic naan and rice . Especially the prawns as starters was nice. Large big screen to watch IPL. Parking has limited space though. Keep up the good work Ajay chef ...we could see ur hard work through the windows and attending to every order personally once it left the kitchen... Consistency is the key..."
5,"An outstanding dining experience in Nepal! This premium restaurant offers a perfect blend of authentic Indian flavors and exquisite seafood dishes. Every dish is crafted with perfection, using high-quality ingredients and bold spices that truly elevate the flavors. The ambiance is elegant, the service is warm and attentive, and the presentation is impeccable.

There was a slight delay in delivering the order to the table, but the exceptional taste and quality of the food made it well worth the wait. A must-visit for food lovers seeking a luxurious culinary journey!"
5,"After hearing so much praise about this restaurant, we decided to visit for a friend's birthday, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The ambiance was perfect--luxurious yet welcoming--and set the stage for an incredible meal. The food was absolutely exquisite, each dish a masterpiece that reflected the chef's extraordinary talent. Every bite was bursting with flavor, showcasing a level of craftsmanship that's second to none. The service was impeccable, with staff going above and beyond to make the evening special. It was the perfect way to celebrate, and we can't wait to return."
2,"The food was horrible, service even worse. It is not a fine dining place at all!! The servers knew nothing about the food and wine they were serving and had no service etiquette, something as basic as checking if there is proper cutlery in the table. The food had nothing to boast about the chef! The only good thing about this place was the location and the interior or the place, may be the toilet. Rest - was pure disappointment!"
2,"Came to this restaurant multiple times. Food is good but service chai is bad on friday nights. We asked for heater almost 5 times, nothing. We waited for water for 20 minutes. Still nothing. One of the waiter was pretty rude, others weren't. Plus too much salt on one of the dishes we ordered. Won't come here again."
5,The ambiance was excellent.  The food and beverages were superb. Sujan provided exceptional service.
5,amazing food great ambience. highly recommended!!!
5,Best food prime location and friendly Staffs.
5,Very good place and food
5,"I had an excellent dining experience at Dining by Chef Ajay. Everything about this restaurant was top-notch--from the ambiance to the food and service. The dishes were exceptionally well-prepared, full of flavor, and beautifully presented.
A special mention goes to our waiter, Sailesh Lama, who made the experience even better. He was extremely polite, attentive, and ensured that we had everything we needed. His professionalism and friendly nature truly stood out."
5,It's such a fine dining place and the best thing is their food. Food is beyond amazing. Wonderful experience!!
5,"I was very satisfied, near the center yet very calm at night, for the record that was 2 years ago and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday."
3,"The property is average only. But few staffs from restaurant and room service were great. Located inside the market. Doves will be there at your windows, they will make noise so you won't be able to sleep properly. Breakfast is below average only. Promised a wake up call for my early morning flight but I had to wake up the receptionist for my check out. I stayed at a room without balcony. Trust me there is no such view from the balcony rooms. So go there with average expectations."
5,I have stayed at a dozen hotels in Kathmandu Thamel area.This was on the top of the list of best stays/experiences ever. The friendly and helpful staff were there for every need of mine. Thank you so much.
5,"I recently stayed at this hotel in Thamel market, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The location is absolutely perfect, right in the heart of the vibrant Thamel area. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile.

The vibes are fantastic; the atmosphere is both calm and peaceful, making it a great retreat after a day of exploring. Plus, the hotel is neat and clean, which is always a top priority for me.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant stay in Kathmandu!"
5,"Heaven, palace, excellent"
5,"Great place to stay in Kathmandu, staff is very friendly and really keen to make our stay enjoyable. Location is close to central, quiet area, room is very big, nice concept, bathroom is clean and well equipped. Breakfast is exceptional, various options, both nepalese and continental dishes. Excellent value for money."

5,"Staff were great, very attentive and helpful.  Hotel is very nice (for a budget hotel), but my room could use some work -- 2 of 3 room electricity outlets were broken, and the bathroom light did not work (so difficult to see while shaving).  Free breakfast was good (buffet with many selections).  A nice courtyard for eating.  My room had no fridge, contrary to what the website said.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay."
5,"Really enjoyed my stay here this week.  Staff was absolutely outstanding; friendly and helpful.  Room was cozy and warmly decorated.  Outdoor courtyard area is pretty and peaceful; nice place place to relax with a beverage.  I almost exclusively walked places during my stay and found the location convenient.  Only minor complaints were that the bed was a little too firm for my taste, and room could use a little more lighting."

I always visit here when I come to Nepal. This is my fourth time. I stay here for one or two days when I enter or leave the country, and they always provide clean and good service. They help me a lot even when I have to check out late because of my flight. The massage at the spa in the hotel is also good. I tried the aroma massage, and the trekker massage is literally a relaxation after trekking, so it is a bit painful, but the aroma massage is comfortable and good. Next time I come after trekking, I want to try the trekking massage."

4,Great hotel at a very reasonable price. Breakfast was great.
5,"We had a great time at the hotel with excellent service and a nice buffet. It's an established hotel with proper setup. It has one Indian dish in the morning buffet everyday. They provide complementary airport pick-up facility also.
Mr. Mandip and Mr. Sujay have been very helpful for every requirement.
Thanks alot to the whole team."
1," Horrible experience. We booked the room for 20 days. Paid advance for1 night. The next day when reached to the hotel, receptionist informed that the room which we paid for was already taken. We had no choice but to stay for atleast a day. Room bedsheets were not clean. Requested for hot water, they said the technician is already gone so tomorrow.
Later at night we ordered burger, it was too cold. When Requested to heat it up, the chef Tekraj  from inside was shouting with the waiter stating that ( FROM WHERE THIS GUEST CAME, VILLAGERS. THEY HAVE NEVER EATEN THE BURGER BEFORE. I WILL NOT HEAT IT.) But the waiter Keshav insisted in a polite way then the chef heated the burger.
Very bad experience."
5,"Had a great stay at Dom Himalayan Hotel in Thamel! The location is perfect--right in the heart of Thamel and close to party spots, but still quiet and peaceful. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was tasty with good options. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Kathmandu!!"
4,Hotel bien place.
5,"Super hotel. Byli jsme zde ubytovani pred a po nasi expedici Mera peak 6476m. Krasne pokoje, pohodlna postel. Snidane byla vynikajici, opravdu jsme si pochutnali. Je to v centru Thamelu - idealni poloha. Hotel se nachazi v klidne lokalite."
5,Super emplacement pour un hotel tres agreable. Un joli jardin attenant pour y manger grace a deux restaurants. Je recommande a 100% !!
5,Spacious rooms. Very nice and cooperative staff.  Good food and morning breakfast. Centrally located. Nearby good shopping centers
5,Nagyon kedvesek!
4,"This hotel is one of the best hotels in the Thamel area. Neat and clean big room. Great location. Room service is a little bit slow but staff behaviour is very good. A little bit disappointed for their buffet breakfast. Very limited item and most of the items are tasteless. I think this is the only hotel in the Thamel area with a lift facility. So, this hotel can be a good choice for those visiting Kathmandu who want to stay in a luxurious hotel in a quiet environment with lift facilities."
4,"I booked this place awhile back for my dad. He enjoyed the room facilities and the front-desk hospitality. However, a taxi driver assigned to pick up my unsuspecting and exhausted dad from the airport asked money from him for the ride although it was covered in the advance booking. I advise the hotel to take measures to curb unscrupulous petty scams and miscommunication between the systems/ staff that prevent customers from revisiting."

4,Small inn/hotel nestled in Thamel street. Good home vibe and convenient location.
4,"Stayed here 1 night on the 14th of Sep before heading off for our EBC trek. Overall a decent hotel for an affordable price, the room and beds were clean and I really liked the sitting area just outside the entrance of the hotel! Didn't interacted much with the hotel staff but they all seemed very nice! Very close proximity to many trekking shops which was perfect for us as well!

I do have to point out that there were workers painting the outside of our window/balcony during our stay and when we were napping in our room, one of them kept knocking on the window and when I went to check what he wanted, he asked whether if we could unlock the balcony door and let him in our room so he could go down from the inside of the hotel so he could ""save time"" instead of going down from the outside of the balcony??? Quite odd and I was a little annoyed as I was napping and he wouldn't seem like he would stop knocking unless I checked what he wanted."
5,"Perfect
Everybody is very friendly, like Niki and others"
5,"Exceptionally attentive and non-intrusive staff providing professional service. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Breakfast always had a huge variety to cover all kinds of palates and it full of value. The hotel is recessed into an alley and that is big plus - it is shielded from hustle and bustle of central Thamel, yet you have access to anything you need."
5,"Located in thamel itself, it's uniquely located for you to walk to attractions in thamel or to get rides get around town. Hotel itself has a quiet charm in the busy thamel street outside with room service from the inhouse restaurant n even a massage center. The hotel itself gave complimentary morning breakfasts in buffet style during my stay with calls to remind us that we might miss out on the last service n gentle reminders on check out time - where they obliged me with a late check out too. Among the services I enjoyed were them helping me with arranged a ride to the airport on my app as well as bell boy service. They accept master n visa card on top booking via Agoda. Great location, nice charm n hearty meals"
5,"Hotel owner is very nice person
& staff has good behaviour"
5,My experience of this Hostel Fantastic. Dinesh was a brilliant host and I will highly recommend it. I would highly recommend
5,Good hostel. Stuff is very helpful.
5,"Everything is amazing about this place, clean, affordable, friendly, and the staff is amazing! The 2 friendliest workers are the receptionists, Munal and Sushmita helped me out a lot, I stayed here for 1 month and if I ever come back to Nepal, I will definitely stay here again"
5,"I came here as a solo female traveler and I'm SO happy I did. Everyone who stayed here was so friendly and felt like home very quickly. The location is so close to the shopping area and local restaurants I never had to get a taxi! The food at the hostel is wonderful, and the staff is great! This is by far one of my favorite hostels I've been to and would book again if I ever find myself back!"
5,"I stayed at Wonder Thirst Hostel and had a really good experience. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was perfect for meeting fellow travelers. The rooms and common areas were clean and well-maintained.

One of the best parts was the balcony view - you can see the streets, local life, and even some of the nearby hills from there. It's a great spot to relax in the evening and soak in the vibe of the city.

The location is also convenient, close to Thamel and public transport. Amenities like hot showers and Wi-Fi worked well.

Only minor issue was that it could get a bit noisy at night, but that's common in busy areas.

Overall, a solid choice for budget travelers and backpackers. I'd definitely recommend it!"
5,Great experience staying here. Lovely atmosphere. Helpful staff. I would definitely recommend and stay again in the future.
5,Restaurant was good. The hostel was great. Rooms are clean and staff is excellent. Munal was very helpful.
5,Last day we have visited the Wander Thirst. There we did Dinner as well as spend the beautiful peaceful time with get-together with friends.  Very nice place to hang on and feel peaceful energy.
5,"Das beste Hostel in Kathmandu, Preislich top,Sauberkeit top,Essen top und alle Mitarbeiter sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wir konnten ohne Probleme fur den selben Preis verlangern. Es gibt 24 Stunden Security und die Tore werden ab 22 Uhr geschlossen. Auch sehr fur Radreisende zu empfehlen, wir sind selber von Deutschland bis hier hin mit dem Fahrrad gekommen."
4,It was nice to be a part in this hostel with lots of fun and pleasure
5,"The hostel itself is a vibrant and welcoming space, perfect for backpackers, digital nomads, and solo travelers. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, and the common areas are thoughtfully designed to encourage interaction while also allowing space for quiet relaxation. The rooftop offers a great view of the city, especially at sunset.

What truly sets WanderThirst apart, though, is the atmosphere. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful--always ready to offer local tips or help you book activities. There's a real sense of community here, with regular events and a social vibe that doesn't feel forced.

The Garden Restaurant is a hidden gem. Set in a peaceful courtyard, it's the perfect escape from the hustle of Thamel. The menu offers a good mix of local Nepali dishes and international favorites. Everything I tried was fresh and well-prepared, and the prices are more than fair. The coffee and breakfast options, in particular, are top-notch.

Whether you're looking for a place to meet fellow travelers or just want a relaxing stay with good food, WanderThirst delivers on both fronts. Highly recommended!"
4,"Loved the atmosphere and service
The rooms could be better"
5,"Amazing Stay at Wander Thirst Hostel!
I had an incredible experience staying at Wander Thirst Hostel. From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel welcome with their warm hospitality and friendly vibe.
The atmosphere is perfect for backpackers and solo travelers -- social, relaxed, and full of positive energy.Whether you're in Kathmandu for a short stay or a longer adventure, Wander Thirst Hostel is a top choice. Highly recommended!"
5,"Nice stay !
Really social vibe .
Clean

Recomande  !!"
5,"This hostel was fantastic. The twin private room was comfy - a little hot and stuffy but the fan did the job. Service was overall good, nice people. Only dropped down to a 4 on service due to attitude of staff when told to check with reception about included breakfast. We showed the booking details and also had it the previous day with no issues...but we still had to go and get reception to confirm again."
4,"The place was great. The view upstairs stunning. Would stay there again. great place, great price. People are very kind"
5,"Wow! Great experience! The view from
The dorm is quite amazing! A bit noisy, but worth it! The staff is nice and the place clean!"
5,"The staff are so helpful and friendly. Super social, nice communal areas. Bed in private room is small, room not very soundproof. Trek prices seem more expensive here too, found somewhere a lot cheaper. But a good place to stay"
5,"I love this place. I stayed here before and after my trek and then a third time after a retreat I did here as well. The common area and restaurant are really beautiful and cozy and the food is also good. The staff here is super friendly, approachable and helpful as well. I had a private room and it was all very clean and the wifi works really well and overall I was super happy here. It's also a great place to either be on your own or meet lots of cool travelers from all over the world."
5,"Meilleur hostel de Katmandou, le cadre avec des grands espaces exterieurs, l'ambiance agreable et conviviale, le staff toujours au top du top, la proprete, la nourriture, tout est parfait. Merci Giri et toute l'equipe "
5,"I really enjoyed this hostel and made it my home base before and after trekking. The common areas are really lovely and it's very easy to meet people. I stayed in a private room with a shared bathroom and everything was clean but the hot water doesn't always work for the shower. I liked the location a lot because it is a couple streets off of the main roads of Thamel so it's much more quiet and feels like a little break from the chaos but it's still very quick to get to everything. The vibes here are really good and the food is decent and cheap. The staff is also really nice, I recommend this hostel if you're looking for a chill but social place to stay while in Kathmandu."
4,"It's a nice hostel with a perfect location, central but quiet.

I came here in January and it was a little bit cold since there's no heating but they provided thick blankets.
They had some construction so that made it a little noisy but it was communicated clearly.
Then I came back in April and there were way more people and it was a lot warmer. It's still clean and the people are very friendly.

It's quite a social hostel so if you want you can meet a lot of new friends which is nice. The breakfast is also good.

Thank you - namaste "
5,"I stayed here for 5 days, and it was a great experience overall. The rooftop had an incredible view of the city and sunset . Those who are looking hostel in cheap price and good quality Highly recommended.."
4,"Bon hostel, tres propre, chambre de qualite. Belles parties communes.
Deux points genants pour moi :
- une pancarte qui indique que les chambres inclu le petit-dejeuner (cf. Photo), mais il faut en fait ajouter un supplement ; c'est donc mensonger.
- j'ai paye une premiere fois 1500rp pour une chambre. Je reviens 2 jours apres, on me dit 2500rp. Je n'ai pas bien compris les raisons de cette augmentation soudaine, et suis donc allee voir ailleurs (les hostels ne manquent pas dans la zone)."
5,"Best Hostel in Kathmandu. Amazing staff, nice rooms, tasty food, social atmosphere. Great experience :)"
5,I loved it Here! Great place and really Nice service
5,"Huge hostel with a lot off commen area/space.
From cheap-ass Bunk beds (not the most comfortable) to decent hotelrooms..."
5,"Una buena opcion en Katmandu, instalaciones comodas, ubicado muy cerca de Thamel, brindan asesoria de los trekking del pais."
5,"Very nice hostel for a very good price and perfect location!
Staff were very friendly and helpful:)"
5,Very nice hostel and great place
4,"Nice view from the top floor's Dorms, open and peaceful place...it was pleasant to stay here."
5,"Perfect base for our Nepal trip

For our two-week trip through Nepal in April, we used the hostel as a starting and ending point and spent a total of three nights there.

Excellent trip planning

The special thing about this hostel was the assistance in planning our trip. From the very first day, the owner helped us organize our entire trip and activities. Thanks to his expertise we could enjoy our time in Nepal to the fullest.

From sightseeing tours by motorbike in Kathmandu and Pokhara, to an exciting jungle safari in the Chitwan National Park and a four-day trek to the Mardi Himal View Point, to transfers, accommodations and meals - everything was planned in a professional and uncomplicated manner.

Unforgettable experiences

Another highlight was the last evening. Since it was quiet, we had dinner with the owner and then spent a traditional Nepalese evening in a bar. As a final highlight we went to a modern club in Thamel.

Conclusion

This hostel was not only a place to stay, but also a place that shaped our trip to Nepal. I will definitely stay here again at my next trip to Nepal - a clear recommendation!"
4,"Good room, but electricity and wifi were out for more than a day. Also, I received some wrong information from the staff about bus times that caused me to spend an extra day in Kathmandu. But they were apologetic and kind."

5,"This place is an oasis of tranquility in the middle of thamel, which is quite extraordinary. The beds and blankets are very good and they serve good food."
5,"It is very clean, good located and the stuff are very kind. Also a perfect destination to connect to other trekkers. Definitely will book again!"
5,"Muy agradable con distintos ambientes, desde hamacas, hasta sillas normales."

5,Lovely staff and hostel! Very clean and perfect location in Thamel. We really enjoyed our stay here :)
5,Perfect spot in a crowded city
5,"Najlepszy hostel w Katmandu, a nocowalam w kilku.. przestronne pokoje, goraca woda pod prysznicem, sporo przestrzeni wspolnej wewnatrz, a na zewnatrz restauracja z ogrodem, miejscami do lezenia i bardzo dobrym jedzeniem, polecam"
5,"Good room considering the price, and the restaurant in the hostel is very good and reasonably priced!"
5,Loved this place! Very easy and staff super lovely. Great value for money! Even let us keep our bags for two weeks in their storage for free :)
5,"Stayed here for one night and liked it so much we booked it again for two nights when we returned to the area a few days later. Perfect location for exploring Thamel, good breakfast and spacious private room with decent shared bathroom. Lovely outdoor seating area for breakfast / chilling out - a peaceful oasis after the busy streets of Kathmandu!"
5,"For the price, this place is outstanding. The roof dormitory is light, spacious and airy with views across Kathmandu. The cleanliness is exceptional, as is the WiFi. Hot water and free drinking water is also available. Would recommend 100%"
5,"Amazing hostel, very well located, amazing staff, great food, clean and spacious room! Great vibes in general - we have been there four times and really felt like home! Will be back there :)"
5,"Fantastic location and good atmosphere. Beds on the top floor have no blinds, so you are essentially waking up with the sun. However, you do get an awesome view of the city."
5,"Ho trascorso 4 notti al WanderThirst Hostel e ne sono rimasta davvero soddisfatta, soprattutto considerando il prezzo super vantaggioso: solo 18 euro in totale per il soggiorno con colazione. Io avevo scelto il dormitorio con 8 posti letto e bagno in comune. Nonostante la scelta casuale, mi sono resa conto subito di aver fatto la scelta giusta perche c'e una vista mozzafiato sulla valle. Svegliarsi ogni mattina e godersi l'alba, il tramonto e la notte stellata sopra di voi questa l'esperienza incredibile che vi aspetta in questo ostello.
Tuttavia, di giorno il sole puo essere piuttosto forte e non ci sono tende, quindi meglio approfittarne per uscire e godersi la zona. Se preferite poi dormire completamente al buio vi consiglio di optare per un'altra opzione che offre l'ostello o munirvi di mascherina per coprire gli occhi.

Dormire in un dormitorio da 8 posti letto ha il vantaggio di permetterti di conoscere nuove persone. Nel mio caso, spesso, non tutti i letti erano occupati cosi e risultato anche meno affollato e piu piacevole. Le pulizie venivano fatte quotidianamente, e il personale e sempre stato molto gentile e disponibile. Anche se non ci sono armadietti grandi per riporre tutte le proprie cose, solo di piccoli, ho trovato l'ostello molto sicuro, quindi questo non e stato un problema.

Non c'e un'area per stendere i vestiti e non e consentito lavarli li, quindi se, come me, tornate da un trekking e avete bisogno di lavare qualcosa, ci sono diverse lavanderie nelle vicinanze. La colazione, inclusa nel soggiorno, offre tre opzioni e la possibilita di scegliere una bevanda, e l'ho trovata piuttosto buona.

Il punto forte e anche la posizione: l'ostello e centrale ma allo stesso tempo tranquillo, con diverse aree relax. E vicinissimo a negozi, ristoranti e altre comodita. Ho prenotato tramite Booking last minute (la mattina per la sera) e consiglio vivamente questo ostello a chi cerca un soggiorno economico ma con tutti i comfort essenziali."
5,6 nuits passees dans cet hostel tres propre et aux parties communes tres agreables. Top pour rencontrer du monde
5,"Loved staying here, great beds and close to everything you'd want to see in Thamel"
5,"If you are in the Thamel area of Kathmandu and seeking a vibrant, clean, and community-rich hostel, be sure to check out Wanderthirst. The hostel has some of the most impressive communal areas I've seen in the area, and it promotes a comfortable environment for travelers and nomads alike. I am very grateful to the front desk team for their helpfulness and attentiveness, and will be sure to stay here again when I return to Nepal. The coffee and bar area is well-priced and the staff is incredibly friendly. Don't miss this one, y'all! 10/10."
5,"The coolest hostel I've ever met in Nepal is the cleanest, it's cleaned 4-5 times a day!!!! The administrator is always smiling and will always help in any matter! Everything is very convenient! Quiet and peaceful place! There is a roof for yoga classes!!! I highly recommend this place to everyone, you won't regret it!!!"
5,"Good guys , good mind , good place"
5,Give it a try; you won't regret it. It's also a great spot for working on your laptop.
5,"Tolles Hostel mitten im Zentrum mit einem schonen Garten, um dem Trubel zu entfliehen. Die Privatzimmer sind gemutlich und haben alles was man braucht."
5,"Muito acolhedor e amigavel ajudam com tudo o que precisas

Un restaurant com un espaco fantastico."
5,"Great value for money, fun people, cool atmosphere. Exactly what I expected from a hostel"
4,"I came for indra jatra festival. Though the location is somewhat far from durbar square, I liked the atmosphere around."
5,"I spent here for 7-8 days, and it was a great experience overall. The rooftop had an incredible view of the city, perfect for relaxing after a day of exploring. The hostel offered plenty of amenities and was very affordable, especially for being in Thamel. However, it was located a bit too far inside the area, which made it slightly inconvenient at times. Despite that, the stay was comfortable, the staff were friendly, and it was easy to meet other travelers. For the price, it's a solid choice, especially if you want good views and tasty food and amenities."
5,The middle outside area is really nice. The price is good as well
5,"This is a truly lovely hostel! The dorms very very clean and comfortable with large windows.
There is a beautiful garden common area blow the restaurant with hammocks and a variety of nice seating. The staff are extremely kind helpful, even going so far as to let me use one of their computers for an afternoon. This hostel is great value and the atmosphere and facilities make it a well worth the stay!"
5,"Stayed here twice. Solo female. Before and after trekking. Cannot recommend enough. Amazing staff and owner/trekking company. Clean, comfy beds, hot showers (propane). No complaints. 100% recommend. Everyone is very attentive, friendly and wants to ensure good stay. Nepal was a bit out of my budget for me during my up t'il now 7 months of travel however the experience makes it all very much worth it."
5,"If you want a good sleep, go to this hostel.
It is not a party hostel but all staffs are really nice and accommodating.
They also have a huge common areas."
5,Best Hospitality service provided by the staff....Binod karki...Biijay....Susmita subedi..Keshav also Binod mishra. Nice food and nice vibe. Thank you so much for the guidance.

5,Lively
4,"Bel locale, molte belle ragazze"
5,Best Club in Kathmandu
1,"LOD Club was a complete waste of time and money. The experience was one of the worst I've ever had -- poor service, bad management, and nothing worth the hype. Truly disappointed and would never recommend this place to anyone. No parking available.And also I didn't recommend in top 50 clubs so please avoid this club in NEPHAL KATHMANDU"
4,Best club
2,"At First we need to pay entrance fees Of npr1000 per person and for female entry is free of charge.This is a detailed review after going there for  4 days continuously We enjoyed day 1 day and 2 very much because the crowd was decent and fulfilled as per the capacity and on 3rd day which was friday night there were too much of crowd and they kept on giving entry to more and more people i think they should increase the capacity. too much crowd was irritating, Some people tried to harrased girls and they ask security for help but on this matter security only warned them and it happened 3-4 times in the end group of females changed their position and it also happened with some other groups of females. Lod  they called themselves as the 44th club in terms of dj , no doubt the dj is very impressive and we enjoyed it alot but the security should be on the main priority, on the 4th day which was Saturday there was live music show which was in nepali , Music was good but language was nepali which was not understood by us. After 12pm dj started The dj was impressive as it was on earlier 3 days but Again too much full , more than the capacity, Club should increase the capacity, If you want to pull in as much as people you want you should have the capacity, On Saturday there were many guyss who were totally illiterate Disrespectful and Badly dressed, they were literally pushing each other and Ruining the Aura of the club. I think lod should have Some decorum They should not allow these people there should be some strictness in security and also Only allow people which are well dressed and well mannered and if some of them are not behaving well they should be kicked out .

So the conclusion is that
Dj is best no doubt but on the other aspects which is security
Capacity
Accessibility to drinks should be improved
(Lod) If you guys genuinely care about feedbacks Please try to improve on these point our group is a big fan of clubs you guys are on top in nepal but due to these points Your image is getting ruined so please improve on this !!
If you guys are planning to go lod i think you should avoid Fri and Saturday Rest of the days will be more fun"

3,"Recently, I visited LOD Night Club, and it was a thrilling experience. The atmosphere was energetic with loud music and dazzling lights all around. The DJ played exciting tracks that kept the crowd dancing. The combination of flashing lights, beats, and lively people created a vibrant mood. It was a fun and memorable night, full of energy and entertainment."
5,"The ambiance at the establishment is quite inviting, creating a relaxed atmosphere for patrons. The diverse menu offers a wide array of options to suit various tastes and preferences. Service is generally attentive and friendly, contributing to a pleasant dining experience. The quality of the food and beverages is consistently good, making it a worthwhile visit. Overall, it is a recommended destination for those seeking a good time."

4,"Nice place, you can see lot of local as well as some tourist coming here to grab some drink and light the dance floor.. songs played here are good.. gives you a80's 90's vibe.. some new songs as well...
But be mindfull of some miss behaviour from some lical guys..
For gents its 1000nepali rupee entry fee.. for females its free entry if you going as couple.."

5,Fantastic place to party!
3,It was fun but it's not for me.
5,Must visit place in Thamel area for clubbing and party
4,"Lord of the drinks, an international bar chain, is a popular night escape in Kathmandu valley. Situated amidst the hustle and bustle of the vibrant Thamel in Kathmandu, Lord of the drinks is gaining popularity as a premium night bar and club in Kathmandu. An interesting trio of drinks, food and amenities, nails the perfection of vigorous nightlife culture in Nepal.

As the dusk begins, the nightlife in Kathmandu starts. While the rest of Kathmandu is sleeping, Thamel stays awake. The enthralling ambience of Lord of the drinks itself is one of the supreme and highly honored clubbing fun in the valley.

The spacious setting, and the great musical choices, with highly professional amenities and services, Lord of drinks in Nepal has been serving in Nepal with the finest professionalism. The live music and the happenings in Lord of the drinks attract a lot of domestic and international tourists, making it a perfect night escape in Kathmandu valley. The lively and vivid atmosphere of Lord of the drinks is at its best. The mesmerizing settlement and internal ambience of this bar is perfect to lure anybody to make the night out with some head bangs and dancing parties."
1,"I've noticed this club's atmosphere has gone downhill over time. The crowd it attracts lately is very unpleasant, and it no longer feels like the same quality place it once was. It seems the management is focusing on attracting a worse crowd instead of maintaining a safe, enjoyable environment for everyone. Really disappointing to see this decline."

The drinks were unique but I did not enjoy them as much as I did the food.
The place is fancy and cozy though I found it very small compared to what I had expected from the reviews and picture from the websites.

The food was excellent -- fresh, flavorful, and well-presented. Every dish we tried was delicious, especially the appetizers and grilled items. The drinks menu also has a great variety, and the cocktails were well-crafted.

Service was warm and attentive without being intrusive. The staff made sure we were comfortable throughout the evening.

If you're looking for a place with great food, a chill vibe, and a rooftop setting that makes the experience even better, BARC should definitely be on your list. Highly recommended!"

5,"Very atmospheric, very gracious, the food is wonderful as well"
5,"Barc is phenomenal and I was genuinely impressed. The drinks are, of course, delicious. More than that, though, they are delicious drinks that draw on local ingredients and local food culture. I had the twist of Imli, an expert combination of coriander, lemongrass, and tamarind flavors. They also have drinks referencing local snacks or using local alcohol varieties. I had the Ayla sour, a great way to showcase their ayla in a cocktail. The hospitality is also top-notch and by innovative bartenders who know what they're doing. Thanks to Swadhin Raj Gurung and Sagar Bista for taking care of me."
5,"My favorite bar in Kathmandu. Incredible cocktails (and very innovative cocktail menu), fab food  and outstanding service. Has indoor as well as outdoor section. While reservation may not be mandatory, would suggest making one especially if you want to a specific section. Went twice in my short trip to Kathmandu"
5,"Bar a cocktail a faire ! Endroit magnifique, carte divine, les cocktails sont delicieux et la nourriture exquise !
L'ambiance parfaite !
Le personnel extremement sympathique !
Je vous recommande vivement d'aller y faire un tour pendant votre sejour, ca en vaut vraiment la peine !
La vue est egalement splendide !

J'ai failli ne pas y aller, j'y aurais vraiment perdu quelque chose !"
5,"Best cocktails in the valley. We particularly appreciated their swift and polite service, the ambience (enjoyed sitting on the patio and watching some local birds fly by), and their unique cocktails you can't find anywhere else! I had the Indian Summer which was briny, tangy, and refreshing; my partner had the Airy Khattu which (per him) tasted exactly like the khattu he had growing up. French fries hit as well. A true speakeasy; good luck finding the door."

5,Barc is hands down the best spot in Kathmandu! The cocktails here are top-notch. The food is delicious too! Everything I've tried has been spot-on and pairs perfectly with the drinks. Barc is a must visit!
5,"I live abroad, so I contacted the team at Barc via email and WhatsApp to organize my mum's birthday celebration. They had an amazing time, as expected, and loved everything from the food and drinks to the atmosphere.

I will definitely visit this best cocktail bar in Nepal when I arrive. As a professional bartender myself, I'm really excited to try some awesome signature Nepali cocktails.

Thank you, Team Barc!"

5," A World-Class Gem in the Heart of Nepal 

BARC is nothing short of extraordinary! As a proud winner of the Top 50 Best Bars in Asia, this spot effortlessly lives up to its reputation. The cocktails are nothing less than masterpieces--crafted with precision, innovation, and a deep respect for the art of mixology. Each drink tells a story, balancing flavors so perfectly that you're left savoring every sip.

And then there's the food. Michelin-level bar bites that redefine what you thought was possible from a bar menu. Each dish is an explosion of flavors, expertly curated to pair with the drinks or stand alone as culinary works of art.

The ambiance? Impeccable. BARC combines a sophisticated, yet welcoming vibe with exceptional service that makes every visit unforgettable. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a night out, this is the place to be.

Nepal has truly put itself on the map with this world-class destination. Highly recommend to anyone seeking a once-in-a-lifetime bar experience. "
1,"Terrible experience on a Friday night. They refused to serve everything we asked for because they apparently had sponsors and weren't serving anything except for one or two drinks allowed by the sponsor. They should have either not allowed guests without reservations or guests who didn't 'check their instagram' or provided 'limited menu'.
FYI, it wasn't even mentioned on their social media that they were serving limited drinks."
5,"Barc offers a luxurious bar experience with its elegant decor, impeccable service, and innovative cocktails. The ambiance is a perfect blend of sophistication and comfort, enhanced by plush seating and an outdoor area. Their signature cocktails, like the ""Berry Bubble, Bubble Bucha and Khattu"" are as visually stunning as they are flavorful. Attentive staff ensure a personalized experience, while gourmet bites like momos with chili oil and cheesy fries elevate the evening. Though on the pricier side, it's worth every penny for a night of refined indulgence. Ideal for dates or intimate gatherings, reservations are a must."
5,"Special thanks to hemraj for an amazing service loved the ambience, drinks and food "
5,Brilliant. Must go to. Make sure you've got finances tho $$$
5,"Barc is a fantastic spot with good food,  great ambiance, and enjoyable music. They offer a wide varieties of well-prepared and flavorful dishes. I really recommend the chilli momo to anyone visiting. The setting of the place is really cozy, welcoming and stylish. The background music adds just the right touch, creating a lively but comfortable atmosphere for dining or socializing."

5,"I had the best experience here at Thamel Boutique Hotel. Walked in late in the night to change hotels, and was greeted by the very friendly Avishek Regmi. He gave us a great deal, and I even got a free upgrade due to low season. Never stopped saying hi and welcoming me whenever I go in and out of the hotel. 

The manager, Jayaram Adhikari, was extremely friendly as well, and walked me to a post office for some postage needs that I had. Loved the amenities, cleanliness, and facilities of the hotel.

The hotel is very close and walking distance to great spots to visit - LOD, Forest Plate, Himalayan Java Coffee, Paradise Spa, Everest Momo (next to Saraswati Multiple Campus), all my favourite spots whenever i'm back in Thamel!

10/10 "
5,"My wife and I had an amazing stay at Thamel Boutique Hotel. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, and the bathroom had proper hot and cold water with all toiletries provided.

The rooftop restaurant was a highlight - we enjoyed delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner with a beautiful view. The food was fresh, healthy, and full of flavor.

Location-wise, it's right in the center of Thamel but still peaceful inside. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

Highly recommended for couples or anyone looking for a clean, quiet, and well-located hotel in Kathmandu. We'd definitely stay here again!"
5,"Very good service by Avishek!

5,Best Hotel for stay. And Staff are very friendly 
1,"The food quality was pathetic . We ordered mutton curry and they served the worst ever mutton curry, uncooked, tasteless and total watery gravy. The worst part was that upon our request they did not even change nor correct the mistake. We left in hunger but the hotel manager charged full value with a very unapologetic manner.
Will recommend not to dine there."
5,"A True Gem in Thamel - Thamel Boutique Hotel, Kathmandu

We keep coming back to Thamel Boutique Hotel, and for good reason - it's simply a place that feels like home.

This great hotel is located in a quiet corner of vibrant Thamel, and it is the perfect mix of Nepali charm and modern comfort in perfect location.

The rooms are clean, spacious & cozy, and beautifully designed.
The beds are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom, the hot water always works, Wi-Fi is strong, and everything is maintained to a high standard.

What truly makes this place special is the people & the service they give. Jaya ji, the manager, is one of the kindest and most generous people we've met. His presence and care are felt in every detail. And Sandeep from the dining area is a very very helpful devoted worker of this hotel, and we appreciate him a lot.

The location is ideal - close to everything, yet peaceful. The rooftop balcony  and restaurant is lovely for a quiet breakfast or evening tea. And by the way, the breakfast buffet is really yummy

Beyond being a great place to stay, this hotel is a lesson in thoughtful design, smooth management, and excellent maintenance. You can feel the love and intention in every corner.

We'll definitely keep returning - it's just the best place to stay in Kathmandu.

Dhanyavad "

5,"We stayed here one night before flying back home. What a great way to end our 2 month journey in Nepal. It is super clean and rooms are very comfortable, it made us feel like we upped our game. Super hot showers, with high pressure and they even provide toiletrees. Room also had AC and the breakfast was a buffet style with great variety of sweet and savoury. The best thing though was the staff running the hotel. They were so welcoming and ensured that all the time we are cared for. Even helped us weighing our luggage. The manager running the place was exceptional and have to commend his customer centric approach. Thank you for an excellent stay at your hotel."

The rooms are clean, the hot showers are great, and the location is absolutely perfect. The food here is bloody good - I couldn't get enough of their mutton biryani and ended up having it at least three times! Out of our 40 days in Nepal, we stayed here for about 12 days, which says a lot about how much we liked it. Highly recommend!"

5,"My 3 daughters and I visited this place after reading good reviews on Google Map and also since it is fairly close to the hotel we are staying at (Oasis Kathmandu Hotel).  The food did not disappoint.  All was good except that the food came out a bit slow.  The young lady serving us was friendly.  All in all, a very great place to go have authentic meal in Kathmandu."

The waiter asked if I could handle spice, and I confidently said yes. The portion was generous, and the dish was absolutely delicious.

Personally, I didn't find it spicy, but it's a must-try if you're looking for a great meal."
5,"Super Essen von super nettem Personal. Die Preise sind sehr fair und die Portionen angemessen gross. Gerade wenn man in einer grosseren Gruppe kommt oder viele Leute zu Gast sind, sollte man sich jedoch bewusst sein, dass das Essen etwas langer dauern wird, da alles frisch zubereitet wurde. Uns hat es personlich nicht gestort. Andere haben aber evtl. Weniger Zeit oder Geduld. Wir kommen jedenfalls sehr gerne wieder."

3,"We visited this restaurant on the evening of November 14th, initially discovering it by chance on our way to another dining spot. Intrigued by the promise of an organic thali featuring Karnali Marsi rice and region-specific lentils, we decided to stop and give it a try. However, our high expectations quickly deflated. The thali included broiler chicken instead of the local chicken advertised on the menu. The vegetable offerings--pumpkin curry and vegetable pear--were quite ordinary, and the lentils served were the common pigeon pea variety, not the unique black bean lentils from Jumla as expected. These disappointments, along with several other concerns, made for a less-than-satisfactory experience."
5,Delicioso! Las camareras super agradables y serviciales. La comida buenisima y con porciones grandes. Buen ambiente en una especia de terraza y musica tipica
5,"Amazing service and food!!! Staff is so friendly, so funny, so nice, we had so much fun + the food is so tasty and very good price. I can only recommend! I wish I'd stay longer in Kathmandu to be able to come back<3 thank you!!"

5,"I serendipitously stumbled across this place by accident, I was actually looking for a different momo place nearby but couldn't find it but was starving so decided to come here and I am so glad I did!
I had the Tibetan house veg platter not really knowing what to expect and got a bit of everything - momos, stir fried/grilled veg, potatoes, soup and these delicious doughy breads that soaked up all the delicious soup so well.
The food was incredibly rich & tasty and the portion was very generous - absolute great value for money.
Service was also very friendly 
I'm so happy I discovered this place and will absolutely be coming back on my next visit to Kathmandu, highly recommend!"

3,"I tried one of their top recommended foods (keema noodles), but I'm not convinced by the overall taste based on the number of positive reviews they have on Google.

The noodles were quite overcooked. I requested extra spicy, but they were only moderately spicy-no extra hot sauce provided. I did not try any other food items, but there are clearly better options for keema noodles.

However, the ambiance was simple, clean, and pleasant, and the staff were also really good. I'd give it a try on additional foods in the future."
5,Vraiment bon ! Je recommande les Keema noodles 
5,"Nice and cozy cafe in the Thamel area.

The food was delicious and the staff very polite."
1,"Can't talk about the food as it never arrived. I was initially asked to order another dish than I originally wanted, as my wish would take at least half an hour. So I ordered something else, and after 45min it still wasn't there. Guests who came after me got served, and when I asked if my order got lost along the way, staff was like 'nonono just one minute away' but the chef clearly showed no sign of knowledge of my order. Forgetting orders happens, but at least be honest about it. No need to sweep mistakes under the rug, it's not authentic and gives a bad image. I paid my drink and left."
5,"Excellent dans l'assiette et pour l'ambiance. Nous avons meme danse ensemble a la fin du repas.

Nous avons ensuite pris le cours de cuisine avec l'ecole namaste cooking school, sushila etait notre chef et tout etait parfait.

5,"During our recent visit to Kathmandu, we had the pleasure of dining at Karnali by Spize, and it turned out to be one of the most satisfying culinary experiences of our trip. Located in a cozy setting, this restaurant not only serves delicious food but also offers warm hospitality that makes you feel right at home.

Food Quality

The highlight of our meal was the Chicken Thali, which was absolutely delicious. The thali was well-balanced, offering a perfect blend of flavors that were both rich and comforting. Each component of the dish was thoughtfully prepared, from the tender chicken to the flavorful sides, making it a hearty and satisfying meal. We also tried the mid-fried momos, which were equally impressive. The momos had a perfect texture--crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside--with a filling that was seasoned to perfection. These dishes clearly demonstrated the restaurant's commitment to quality and authentic taste.

Ambiance and Hospitality

What truly set our experience apart was the exceptional hospitality provided by the two ladies who served us. Their warm and welcoming demeanor made us feel like we were dining at a friend's home rather than in a restaurant. They were attentive without being intrusive, ensuring that we had everything we needed and were comfortable throughout our meal. Their genuine care and friendliness added a personal touch to the dining experience, making it all the more memorable.

Overall Experience

Karnali by Spize is more than just a restaurant; it's a place where you can enjoy delicious food in a warm, home-like atmosphere. The combination of expertly prepared dishes and heartfelt hospitality makes it a standout dining spot in Kathmandu. Whether you're in the mood for a flavorful Chicken Thali, crave some tasty momos, or simply want to experience genuine Nepali hospitality, Karnali by Spize is the place to go. We left with full bellies and happy hearts, and we highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a truly enjoyable dining experience."
5,"Everything we had was fantastic, and Sushila was so nice!!! Delicious and welcoming restaurant, we had kheema noodles, chicken momo, and thentuk fry. Definitely worth a visit!"
4,"Decent food, very friendly and charming staff, clean location, nice to sit on the terrace. We can definitely recommend this place."
5,Visited Spize today for dinner and it's the best place in thamel. Best food with best customer service. Keema Noodles was 100/10 and organic thali was same. Staying in thamel for a week and this will be my place for dinner. All the customer service was so good and Sushila is amazing lady with best customer service skill and asking each customers about the food which is very rare to see in nepal. Would definitely give 1000 star if possible

Went for dinner and we had their organic veg thali, steamed chicken momos, a draught beer, and a warm honey-lemon-ginger drink for my sore throat.
The food and the service were great indeed, but seeing a rat scuffle by did not leave a good taste in the mouth. Otherwise, the servers are very friendly and up for a chat(if you are good at talking, I'm not), the food is delicious.
Do visit."

5,"Karnali Organic Thali is a popular restaurant in Thamel that serves traditional Nepali Thali dishes made with organic ingredients. It is known for its delicious food, excellent service, and warm and inviting atmosphere.

The food here is delicious. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. The Thali dishes typically include a variety of dishes, such as dal bhat, tarkari, and achar. The dal bhat is a staple of Nepali cuisine and consists of rice, lentils, and vegetables. The tarkari is a variety of vegetable dishes, and the achar is a spicy pickle.

In addition to Thali dishes, they also serve a variety of other Nepali dishes, such as momos, chow mein, and Newari cuisine.

The ambience at Karnali Organic Thali is warm and inviting. The restaurant has a traditional Nepali decor with wooden furniture and colourful fabrics.

Items we had,
- Keema Noodles (buff) 275NPR
- Thenduk Fry (Buff) 295NPR
- Kothey Mo:Mo (Chicken) 275NPR
- Organic Chicken Thali 650NPR

The Keema noodles and Thenduk were noodles-based and were super. I cannot believe their price was so budget-friendly and the portions were amazing! Perfect for one person! The chicken momo was okay, we had better ones. The speciality of the Thali was it was made with all organic items. We enjoyed the Thali so much! The manager at work was very friendly! Hope you visit this place and get to meet her!"

4,"Cute little cafe in the heart of Thamel. It has a typical Tibetan Cafe/ Restaurant vibe. We ordered chicken momo which was warm, fresh and tasty. Coffee was decent as well.

The best thing about this place is the service and behavior. I did a mistake while ordering and once the food and coffee were served I realized it. I told them that I did a mistake and they changed the food without much questions. It was really a great experience. It was my first evening in Nepal and due to their behavior I had a great start of the trip."

5,"""Staff is really nice ,friendly and take care of the customers"" Very clean & warm welcoming, highly recommend ! "
5,"Ho soggiornato 2 volte, la prima per 3 giorni la seconda 4. Tutte e due le volte sono stato benissimo.
A questo prezzo non si trova niente di meglio in tutto il Nepal.
Oltre alla posizione centralissima, il personale e la vera forza di questo luogo, sono gentilissimi, cordiali, ospitali, simpatici e accoglienti.
Colazione fatta una sola volta perche preferivo esperienze piu local, ma il cibo di ottima qualita e la location perfetta per rilassarsi fuori dal caos della citta!
Consigliatissimo"
5,"For the quality and price, the food is without a doubt the best in Nepal. I really liked the accommodation. I stayed there for almost a month and slept very well every night. Although the bathroom was shared in my case, I preferred a cheaper room of 800nrp per night. The shower was extremely hot and pleasant. The bathroom was always very clean, and the cleaning staff kept it very friendly and attentive. Thank you for the service. If I return to Kathmandu, I will certainly stay there. Good luck."
5,"Estuvimos ahi hace un mes! Y nos encanto!

La ubicacion esta genial para poder visitar distintos lugares, las personas que atienden son muy amables y serviciales, la comida es deliciosa y para extranjeros siempre preguntan que tan picante quieres tu comida jajaja las habitaciones estan limpias y ordenadas, hay distintas categorias.

Durga nuestro nuevo amigo, quien nos ayudo a hablar con el taxista para darle las indicaciones, el atiende con el corazon su lugar y se nota hasta en la gente que selecciono para atenderlo, como Kumar que siempre esta al servicio para apoyar.

Felicidades a todo el staff definitivo regresaremos."
5,This room is really fantastic.  I feel better . Costumers behavior is really fantastic.
5,Very cozy and nice place to stay. I'd say Cafe is the main highlight of this place and the staff who are very friendly and nice. Highly recommend this place to everybody who are seeking a room to stay in Thamel.
5,Clean room with good service.
4,"Very nice hotel in the center of Thamel. Isha at the reception has been very nice and helpful with everything. Milan at the cafe was also very nice and talks French. Only downside is the slow wifi.
Thanks !"
5,"The service here was wonderful, and the place is very clean. I stayed at few other hotels for a similar cost, but Yala Peak Hotel was by far the best. The cafe downstairs serves delicious food and has a quiet green garden. In my opinion, this is the best place in Thamel and offers amazing value for the cost."
5,"Nice serivce , best hotel in Thamel street Kathmandu"
4,"Hotel Yala Peak is fantastic hotel. It is located in thamel area with beautiful indoor garden, terrace and room also. I found their so peace and eco-friendly environment as well as budget friendly room also."

5,Yala Peak gets better every time l stay there. The staff could not be more friendly and kind and run a very efficient hotel. I feel very fortunate to have found this hotel.
5,"Perfect accommodation, super clean, super kind"
5,"Yalapeak Hotel, located near Thamel Marg in Kathmandu, offers a comfortable and convenient stay for travelers. The hotel features clean rooms, courteous staff, and a peaceful environment despite its central location. It balances affordability with quality service, making it a suitable choice for both leisure and business visitors."
5,good services 
5,"Nice and affordable hotel with amazing staff. The lady at the desk was so kind and helpful, everything was amazing. We had a late check in and an early check out and she was so kind and accommodating! Definitely worth staying here again in the future! Location is just pristine"
5,You can blindly go for it...best for stay in thamel
5,"Lovely cafe and affordable accommodation options. The staff and managers are always so welcoming, kind, friendly, and helpful at every point in your stay here. Truly a precious gem here in Thamel"
5,"I recently stayed at hotel yala peak and it was absolutely fantastic. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was so comfortable. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and location was perfect."
5,"Amazing place to experience katmandu with great staff, great local food. Middle of thamel, great to all try activities nearby."
5,"If you want to stay at the heart of Thamel where everything is in the walking distance, this is a place to opt for.
Quiet, friendly ambience, helpful staff.
There's also a cafe downstairs with decent food.
Good value for the price."
5,"Very good place to stay! Our room had two big beds, a private bathroom, and a small kitchen (which we didn't use). We went in summer, so we didn't need much hot water in the shower, but it worked fine.

The staff were very kind and helpful.

The best part was the restaurant -- so, so good! I really enjoyed everything we ordered.

It's right in Thamel but surprisingly quiet. A great value for the money!"
4,I highly recommend this hotel. It was a very comfortable and budget friendly stay there! Staff's were so humble and polite and all the services was great 
5,Very good rooms for the price and very excellent staff and atmosphere is good as well. The restaurant has very good options for food and all the staff is very friendly and great there as well. Highly recommended.

5,"We were originally meant to stay at Yala Peak for 2 nights, but found ourselves returning multiple times throughout our time in Nepal and spent the best part of a week here. It was by far our favourite accommodation during our journey through India and Nepal. Above all, the staff at Yala were delightful: incredibly helpful, kind and welcoming (thank you!!!).

We stayed in three different rooms, all of which were very spacious and comfortable, with access to a balcony where we enjoyed room service dinner one evening. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were all delicious and unrivalled by anywhere else we ate in Kathmandu. We left our luggage here whilst we went trekking and then again for a few nights in Bhaktapur, which was a lifesaver.  The location is brilliant, in the heart of Thamel with a supermarket two doors down and a short walk to Durbar Square. Amazing value, 10/10.

Thank you so much to everyone at Yala for making our stay such a highlight, we were very sad to leave! - Ella and Amy"

4,"Good stay overall! The staff are incredibly kind and helpful. The location is perfect - right in the heart of Thamel but still quiet and peaceful. My first room had excellent WiFi but barely any hot water. After extending my stay, I was moved to another room with better hot water, though the WiFi was terrible and the bathroom flooded whenever I took a shower. The beds were comfortable in both rooms and everything was relatively clean. The restaurant is lovely and has delicious breakfast/food (though a bit pricey next to other places), and the staff there are absolutely adorable. Would stay again, especially if room conditions were more consistent."
5,Bardzo dobra lokalizacja. Bardzo pomocna obsluga. Na miejscu jedna z najlepiej ocenionych restauracji. Pokoje ok.
5,"I have been here for nearly a week and I totally reccomen this place. Is in the center but still really quiet, cleand and staff is really nice, always ready to help. They also upgrade me to a better room for the same price!"
4,"We took a room for four persons, which we got at a very reasonable pricing. The room was quite spacious. The lady on the desk was quite helpful. However, the wifi could've been faster."
5,"Everything perfect, so confortable mattress"
5,"Excellent hotel, chambre economique, spacieuse et confortable.
Une tres bonne adresse idealement placee dans thamel.
Un personnel aux petits soins, et d'excellents petits dejeuners proposes au restaurant de l'hotel.
Je recommande vivement."
5,Lovely hotel in the centre of thamel for a great price. Staff are very nice people
5,The room was lovely and affordable. The location is centrally located and the staff is very accommodating. We liked it so much that we booked one more night we needed on the way back from Pokhara. 10/10 recommend
5,"Very nice hotel for the price! Comfy beds and nice staff.  It is in the middle of Thamel, so a short walk away from shops and Durbar square. They have a cafe that is quite expensive (touristpriced), so I'd go elsewhere for breakfast."
5,"So nice! One of the best hotels in Nepal for the price. Staff are the friendliest people who go out of their way to help you. Location is excellent in Thamel. Pretty clean, for the price you pay it's worth it, other hotels I stayed at and payed more were on the same level or worse. Yala is great!"
5,"Warm shower 24 hour
Delicious food yummy
Comfortable beds.
Room 405 and 401 best deluxe options.
Friendly yala team
Respected owner(Sir) he has beautiful soul.
One of the best human I have ever met
I learned lot from him and sudin Sir is amazing.
All  yala peak hotel and cafe staffs are amazing "
4,Room available 1000 INR very old room but restaurant service is also good near of main road
5,"Ich liebe dieses Hotel, ich wurde in 15 Jahren noch nie enttauscht, danke fur alles !!!"
5,"The best hotel ever in Nepal! We spent one week in Nepal and stayed in around 5 hotels, but this one is amazing.
Staff was perfect, empathetic, attentive. They provided us good room with good view, complimentary water bottles, good laundry and smiled every time
Room was clean, hot air conditioner any time, hot water any timer. All for just 17$ per night
Amazing!"
5,"This was my first visit to KTM, and my first stay was at hotel yala peak. Though I had considered staying/ experiencing another place after coming back from pokhara; I ended up re-booking hotel yala peak again.
Lovely service, and their outdoor seating area is soaked with sunshine in the morning. I enjoyed my teas over there everyday.

Will definitely book them if and when i am back in KTM."
5,"Best place to stay in Thamel - Nepal , great hospitality.... Budget friendly"
5,Mycke trevligt budget hotell
5,"I stayed at Hotel Yala Peak for a few nights before and after going on a trek. Located right in the middle of Thamel, it made it convenient when I wanted to go out to do some exploring. The room was very clean and the service was great! The workers are very helpful and friendly! I contacted the hotel manager, Durga, before heading to Nepal and he assisted me with arranging a room as well as transportation to and from the airport for the trek and when I arrived/departed. They also have laundry service for a reasonable price. I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit!"
5,"I can't emphasize enough how welcoming everyone is in the hotel and coffee. The rooms are comfy, shower has hot water, food is amazing, there is a kettle on the room although I can't find the cups . The location is really good, you are just in the middle of the mingle within walking distance to the Dunbar square, garden of dreams and many more places."
5,"Tres bon rapport qualite-prix. Le personnel est adorable, tres souriant et toujours presents pour repondre a nos questions et demandes ! Nous y avons sejourne deux fois, une fois en arrivant au Nepal et une fois en repartant, bonne experience les deux fois!
Le seul bemol serait la proprete de la salle de bain commune parfois."
5,"One of the best hotels to stay in Thamel, Kathmandu Nepal. The receptionists are especially helpful. The girl receptionists are one who helped us to stay there with a low budget and we got a deluxe room for 4 people. For that, everyone must stay there and enjoy their welcome. I would recommend everyone to stay there. The place is so good in town."
4,Booked one night on 19 Oct before we started our trek. Chose this place due to the close location to our travel agent office. Room and bathroom was average. Not the cleanest but ok for budget hotel. Wifi not strong. Nice view at rooftop and good service by front desk staff and the Cafe. Ordered breakfast early from Cafe. Stored one of our bags  at front desk and collected it after trek. Really helped a lot!
5,"Fantastische plek. Super vriendelijk personeel, heerlijk eten en lekkere wijn. Alles voor een goede prijs. Meerdere keren terug gekomen hier en elke keer zorgde het personeel er voor dat ik weer in dezelfde kamer terecht kon. Het voelde echt als thuis komen! Schone, ruime kamer. Voor mij geen probleem dat er alleen een ventilator was, in oktober geen probleem. Klein minpuntje is dat het heel lang kan duren voordat het water warm wordt. Een verspilling van water."
5,"I booked my stay here for a week as a solo and it was very good here in a budget friendly price, staff were there very welcoming, polite and helpful.
Rooms was good, clean and hygienic, they have all kind of rooms like from basic budget friendly to deluxe rooms. also they have their own cafe and restaurant so you can have your breakfast and delicious meals there. About location wise it was in the middle of thamel city so everything is available near by like famous visiting places, shops, airport etc.
So i will highly recommend for everyone.
Thank you 
Love from India "
5,Room was really good... Employees are also friendly and helpful... The day we returned from Ramechepe their room was packed ... But somehow they managed to provide a room for that night...
4,"Viimenen vaihdettiin kulmahuoneeseen, kauhea meteli kadulta"
5,"Great food and extremely friendly and helpful staff! The rooms are good budget rooms, the price for value is great! Also a plus: the rooms are very quiet at night."
5,"Amazing stay. The staff were the best and kindest I have ever met in my travel, so incredibly helpful. Cafe downstairs was also so good and cheap, best coffee we found. Only downside is the rooms are not AC which was abit of a struggle for us but if your fine with that then defo stay here. Location is great also."
5,"Loved staying here, the staff were so friendly and helpful! Only problem was the lack of aircon in the rooms as they can get really hot and the singular fan doesn't do much, but that was on us for not double checking. The hotel is situated in a really good location and the cafe on the ground floor serves the best coffee!! Absolutely would recommend this place, such good value for money"
5,"This hotel was super nice. Specially their receptionist and all the other staffs are really nice and well behaved. They were cooperative and wiling to help us plan our nepal trip by providing valuable information.
It was in the middle of thamel city so the location of this restaurant was top.
But the rooms are okayish and we stayed in triple bed which didn't have any ceiling fan though thamel becomes chilled in the night. Some rooms didn't have any washrooms."
4,Best and good service by hotel and cafe
5,"The best hotel I can recommend in Kathmandu. Cleanliness, service, warm hospitality, breakfast, the taste of the food - everything was truly perfect. Among the staff, especially Binod Balami is an amazing person. I got sick and he even accompanied me to the hospital; I will never forget his help. He is such a clean-hearted, honest, and genuine person. In Kathmandu, you are in safe hands.

The reception staff also immediately assist with any questions you may have. I cannot thank them enough - they made me feel at home. Everyone does their job with such professionalism, congratulations to all of you.

Lastly, the location of the hotel is fantastic - within walking distance to everywhere. And once you step into the garden, you are surrounded by peace and quiet. There cannot be a better hotel in Kathmandu."
5,"All staff are kind and respectful to everyone, a place that is visible from all sides."
5,Great
5,Best in all
5,"This is truly a great place to stay if visiting Katmandu; the place is like a quiet oasis of calm away from the noise of the city only a short distance away. The accommodation, service and grounds are delightful as so is the cuisine. There is also plenty to see within the Hotel's splendid grounds too, including the art gallery-museum and craft workshops garden and the many decorative ornaments and sculptures.

However, venturing outside the hotel grounds although a fascinating and enlightening experience to see the many splendid shops and eateries, it  is not a healthy experience as the pollution from the never ending traffic jams of closely  packed cars, trucks and motorbikes is so intense you can feel it with every breath.

There have been many, many famous individuals stay at this hotel as you can witness on displays and the pathways around the grounds."
5,"This place gives you different experiences while visiting Kathmandu
I highly  recommend it"
5,"Charming, Instagrammable Stay in the Heart of Thamel
I stayed at Kathmandu Guest House for just one night, but it left a great impression. Nestled right in the heart of Thamel, it's surrounded by cafes, clubs, shopping spots, and currency exchanges -- perfect for tourists looking to explore on foot.

The hotel itself is beautiful and full of character. From lush gardens to cozy corners, it's a photographer's paradise -- super Instagrammable! They even have a museum, souvenir shops, and a tea tasting corner, which was such a lovely touch.

I stayed in an Executive Suite, which was spacious, comfortable, and worth the higher price for a short stay. I noticed that the more budget-friendly rooms felt a bit too small and cramped, so I'd definitely recommend going for the higher category if comfort matters to you.

The breakfast was okay -- I had higher expectations, but it was decent for a one-night stay. The staff were helpful and check-in was smooth. The garden areas and outdoor seating really make it a great place to relax.

My room didn't have a great view, but honestly, the hotel itself is a destination -- I'd love to stay 2-3 days next time just to explore more of it.

Overall, a lovely and peaceful escape in the middle of the buzz of Thamel. Would definitely recommend it for those who want both charm and convenience!"

5,"Kathmandu Guest House is a peaceful escape right in the middle of Thamel -- the courtyard and garden are beautiful, and the location is unbeatable. I stayed three times during my trip and found the Deluxe rooms to be spacious, clean, and well worth the small extra cost. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout, and the on-site spa was excellent after trekking the Manaslu Circuit.

The Standard rooms are quite basic and less clean, so I'd definitely recommend upgrading if possible. Great value for a premium experience by local standards."
5,"Fantastic hotel experience. The hotel is very well located in the center, stepping out the gate numerous shops can be found to satisfy basic needs and shop for souvenirs. There is closed garden in the center surrounded by the hotel buildings to chill or enjoy a cup of tea, etc. The food service is excellent, there is variety for all tastes and purified water tank all over the place to keep hydrated - this is very well-thought. The staff is very kind, approachable and kindly adjusted to our special needs. Places are clean and we were very satisfied with the cleaning service provided."
5,"It's a great place - rooms, good, service, warm purple, ambience - everything.
Being right in Thamel, one is practically in the heart of action. That might mean  nights are not absolutely silent, but only if one is super-sensitive to sound.
It has become a repeat hotel for me. I hope I come here again - once for holiday."
5,"Super nice rooms and grounds. It doesn't feel like you're in Kathmandu at all, but the accommodations are very nice and modern."
5,"Vu l'emplacement de l'hotel au coeur de Thamel, il y a beaucoup de bruits alentours - clubs, bars, noctambules, etc. Pas tres reposant mais c'est le coeur de Kathmandu."
5,"Great base from which to explore Kathmandu, incredible sunset views from the 7th floor sky bar.
Good choice of food /drinks and nice breakfast with fresh omelttes and pancakes available"
5,"One of the best hotels I've stayed at in Kathmandu! The service was incredibly welcoming, and the receptionists were super nice, they even upgraded my room. Everything was very clean, and the garden was beautiful. The location was perfect since it's right in the center of Thamel, making it easy to shop around."

5,Good location and good decent places
5,"Our favourite hang out at the heart of Thamel is Kathmandu Guest House. Our family has been going to this hotel since a very long time and I have very fond memories of this place with my son and my husband. Although, the place changed after the April 2015 earthquake that destroyed the building but not entirely. Anyway, my son & I made new memories this time one evening  and we tried to find out our favourite corners of the hotel which by the way is unrecognisable now. It's so lovely to sit outside in the garden with a chill in the air but a big fire keeps everyone warm and fuzzy. Ayhan, for old times sake bought a book on Nepali Folk Tale. Nepal is tucked away very deeply and comfortably in our hearts and we can never get enough of Nepal. "
5,"Hier wohnten Herr Matthias Halbwidl aus Hollabrunn / Osterreichund Herr Professor Rolf Zinkernagel (Nobelpreistrager Medizin 19..) aus Zurich / Schweiz vom 5.-7. Oktober 2024. Sie waren mit dem Aufenthalt sehr zufrieden. Der Extrembergsteiger Reinhold Messner (80 J., aus Sudtirol) kommt noch jedes Jahr hierher!"
5,Value for money!
5,"Great location right in the centre, yet the hotel has a lovely courtyard that is an oasis. KGH arranged pick up from the airport which was very helpful because we arrived in so late. Our room was spacious and the bed very comfy. We would certainly come back. Thank you"
5,"I very much enjoyed my stay at KGH. Its long history is interesting. It was relatively quiet considering its location in the heart of Thamel. Room was clean, garden is lovely, breakfast buffet was fine. And the cat is friendly. :-) I especially appreciated the staff for storing a duffel bag for me while I was away on a trek. I will be staying there again next time in Kathmandu."
5,"A wonderful stay at Kathmandu Guest House! The location in Thamel is perfect close to everything yet peaceful and relaxing. The gardens are beautiful, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff is incredibly warm and helpful. A perfect blend of history, comfort, and hospitality. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Kathmandu! "
5,"Great location, friendly staff and gear service"
5,Yes I  experience very good
3,"Ich habe das Museum of Nepali Art besucht und war zwischendurch auch im Gartenbereich und wurde auch direkt von einem Kellner angesprochen und gefragt ob ich Kaffee wolle. Der Cappuccino war exzellent (teuer, aber das war zu erwarten). Was mich storte, dass ich viermal gefragt wurde, ob ich nicht zu Mittagessen wolle. Ich finde es anstrengend, wenn ein klares Nein ignoriert wird. Ein zweites Mal nachfragen ist auch in Ordnung. Aber drei bis viermal habe ich personlich als sehr drangend empfunden..."
5,C'etait tres bien et personnel tres a l'ecoute
3,"Prime location, one of the oldest hotel in thamel. It has its own legency and brand. Recently new wing was added. Old buildings rooms are not that comfortable to my liking. Restaurent service is very good. My visiting guest was rejected to room which I didn't like at all."
1,"Last night, my best friend and I decided to have dinner at Kathmandu Guest. It was cold, and we were really looking forward to a cozy, warm meal. But to say we were disappointed is an understatement,The food they served us was cold and raw  cooked. When we tried to get the staff's attention, they were too busy chatting with each other, completely ignoring the guests,They didn't even bother to ask if we wanted warm water, which is basic courtesy, especially on a cold evening. All the staff were just huddled together, gossiping, and seemed completely uninterested in actually doing their job. It felt like we were intruding on their hangout session rather than dining at a restaurant.If you can't be bothered to serve your guests properly, maybe it's time to rethink running a restaurant. Hospitality isn't just about owning a property, it's about how you treat your guests. This was the worst dining experience I've ever had, and I can confidently say I'll never go back.
Not recommending this place to anyone. Worst. Experience ever . #Worsthotel"
5,"Hotel is in the city centre Thamel, great Location, the tourist spots are located nearby to this hotel and even some at walking distance. The ambience in hotel is good with an open garden restaurant.
Rooms are clean, worth every Penny."
5,"""I recently had the pleasure of staying at KGH, Thamel kathmandu, and I must say, my experience was wonderful! The service provided by the staff was exceptional; they were attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was enjoyable. The cleanliness and comfort of the accommodations made it feel like a home away from home. I highly recommend KGH to anyone looking for a delightful getaway. Thank you."
5,"Amazing location , fantastic service all the way through. Breakfast is amazing and all the fantastic team. Couldn't recommend them highly enough. Thank you so much "

5,"What a place. It was me and my friend first international trip and we are glad we chose Nepal.Coming to this place filled our heart.  The music, the staff and the location was all A1 but would like to mention Two young ladies names here who were the part of the staff at the reception Ms Abhisha and  Ms Diya Shrestha  they were generous and kind throughout.  they treated us humbly. I request the hotel staff to give them their part of appreciation. All over it was a great stay"
5,The best place to stay in Katmandu.

1,"The hotel is in a great location, specially if you looking for lively environment. It is close to many famous clubs and pubs in a walking distance & the hotel is really spacious both indoor and outdoor.

However, the service they provide is shocking ! I as a local citizen stayed two nights in this hotel and was in complete shock how the staff behaved and the service provided. First thing first i was side by side with a foreign customer & the difference on their reciprocal was massive. When i asked them about the payment for their services in US dollars, the employee behaviour changed and stopped answering.

Heard a lot about KGH group before but was surprised with such a beautiful hotel, such a lovely ambience, such a great location could provide such a poor service."
5,"Kathmandu Guest House was an incredible place to stay. The staff were very attentive, the room was beautiful and they even gave me a cake for my birthday without charge. I'll definitely be coming back, also because there is a beautiful garden where you can relax while also being in the heart of Kathmandu. The location is fantastic as it's in the middle of Thamel. If you're staying in Kathmandu this is the perfect place to visit"
5,"My daughter just finished a 14 day trek in nepal and booked this hotel for her last day in Katmandu, it was her birthday as well, I contacted the hotel via email and promptly received a email back from Palistha Tuladhar the front office manager , I asked him if it is possible to arrange something for my daughter for her birthday  , when she checked in to hotel they upgraded her and also arranged a birthday cake with a card wishing her a lovely birthday , I am completely amazed of the kind gesture that Palistha Tuladhar arranged on my behalf , Sir your attention to detail and kindness is without a doubt one of the best experiences that I have received from a hotel , I wish I could give more than 5 stars as you deserve it , thank you so much all the way from Australia"
5,"Soggiornare al Kathmandu Guesthouse significa fare un tuffo nella storia. E' una struttura bellissima e un hotel 4 stelle meraviglioso, le stanze sono ampie e molto ben arredate, il giardino bellissimo, ci sono numerosi servizi all'interno e la colazione a buffet e eccezionale.
Il punto di forza, per cui vale la pena spendere qualcosa di piu per gli standard nepalesi, e che trascorri la notte in un luogo storico, dove sono passati tantissimi personaggi, dai piu famosi alpinisti ai Beatles (vedi la walk of fame nel giardino).
Nel cuore di Thamel. Da non  perdere!"
5,"I was there for Tea Bar of Nepal Tea Collective, and that was brilliant. The various initiatives inside the KGH are very interesting."
5,Very good
5,"The staff are very kind and handle any issues with great care. The location is in the heart of Thamel, making it easy to access restaurants and souvenir shops."
2,"Overpriced tourist trap. No storage space whatsoever in the three-man room. Patchy and slooow internet. Not even a wall plug to plug the kettle into is provided in the room's tea making corner, which doesn't include coffee creamer which is standard even in lesser hotels. There are better options in Thamel."
5,"KGH is in the heart of the food and shopping scene, not to mention the location of the Museum of Nepali Art (MoNA). The rooms are wonderfully appointed and the service is spot on with friendly and super helpful staff. The food is delicious no the rooftop bar is a nice spot to take in the surrounding area of Thamel. If you have the opportunity to stay here do it, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Not a good experience.no water for some time in bathroom.very slow flow through drainage.bathroom facilities was very poor.
Staff was very helpful.breakfast excellent.
Other good hotels available in that area at this tarrif."
5,KGH was a great place to stay in the heart of Thamel. The rooms were clean and amenities great! Breakfast buffet served a number of items from various nationalities. The service we received was prompt and attentive. I would highly recommend KGH.
5,Very good rooms. Centrally located. Excellent service. Lots of food and shops options next to hotel.
5,"I love staying at the Kathmandu Guest House when I'm in Thamel because its large garden is such an oasis from the street scene. The standard rooms are fine, but the deluxe rooms are worth the extra price if you want western quality accommodation."
5,"Hands down to the Best Gimbap in the town . Overall the Price, the service , the food .. everything are so amazing. Do visit this beautiful cafe "
5,"Great kimbap, lovely owner. I always love visiting there."
5,"Cafe Hessed is a charming pay-first cafe where you place your order at the counter. The menu is simple and limited, featuring a selection of gimbap, bakery items, and beverages.

We tried the Tuna and Chicken Gimbap, and both were absolutely delicious -- fresh, flavorful, and perfectly balanced. The accompanying kimchi added a delightful kick that elevated the experience even further. It's a no-fuss spot with a cozy atmosphere and satisfying food that leaves you wanting to come back for more."
1,"Very much disappointed with timing.
They closes the cafe way early..
1. Reached at 7 PM on first try but they were closed.
2. Reached around 7 PM on second try and they were closed again. On further enquiry, they said they are open till 6:45 PM only.
3. Reached at 6:40 PM or before that on third try and they said they are closed and only take aways are available.
4. Reached at 6:30 PM on fourth try and they said they wont be serving and only take aways are available.
Though their food tastes good, they should really work on the cafe opening time

Really really pissed off"
4,"Love the kimbap here and also the muffins, the kimchi I had were nearing it's shelf life. Other than that it's always good food at a good price."
4,Good food and cup cakes. Also the place is good to be around if your are fan of gimbap. Worth every penny you pay for.
5,I one of the best place to be on rainy days.
4,"One of the best kimbabs in the Kathmandu Valley. Very affordable price, and the service was super fast. Highly recommended for anyone who loves kimbab. The owners are also sweet and kind."
4,"Food tastes great. Loved it.
The pricing is also pretty good.
Not unnecessarily expensive so hope they maintain the taste and price as well.
They don't provide soya sauce so that felt missing with Kimbap.
Parking not available so its road side parking.
Easy for 2 wheeler hard for 4 wheeler.
It's pay first system.
The soup they provided tastes good.
The service and ambience is okay.
Kimbap tastes great so would love to visit again soon."
5,Best kimbab
5,Best kimbab
5,best kimbap
4,Good food and pretty aesthetics inside
5,"Muffins are really really good.....been visiting the cafe since some years and i really love the quality of the food that they provide.

Always a good time while visiting this cafe."
5,Best in town for gimbap. Make sure to go before 6 PM because they get sold out soon. The bakery items get sold out even faster.
4,"Tried the chicken kimbap and iced chocolate--both were so good! The kimchi they served on the side was surprisingly tasty too. You have to order and pay first at the reception. The walls are nicely painted with minimal art, which adds a cozy touch. Service was good and quick, but the ambience was just okay--if you're someone who enjoys peace and silence, it might feel a bit noisy and echoey. Still, worth a visit for the food! "
5,"Love love love the gimbap here. An absolute favourite!!!
Also the cupcakes are yummyy. Especially the red velvet ones.
They offer limited drink options too."
5,"I highly recommend this place for everyone. Food are fresh and healthy .

gamsahaeyo!"
5,Great place to sip coffee and indulge cup cakes and kimbaps
5,"Always a fan of special kimbap!!  Very quick service even in the rush hour.
Foods to drinks everything were super hygienic and delicious "
4,"The place is cozy and also has a sitting space in ground and first floor. I tried the chicken kimbab and the kimbab was so affordable and very tasty. I liked the soup and the kimchi. The menu serves for veg, chicken, tuna and others too. The lemonade was average, so I would prefer foods moreover drinks at this place."
5,"The goto place if you want to have the best kimbap in town.

The drinks I feel are a little pricy."
4,Affordable kimbap and drinks 
4,"We ordered the veggie gimbap here, it's better than the other places we have been to. The service was very quick, we didn't have to wait much for our order to arrive. The quantity was worth the price."
5,Loved the kimbap here.. I would say a must try 
4,"Had tried red cupcake  which was very tasty( neither too sweet nor tasteless) i.e thikka in taste. Also tried Special kimbab and Tuna kimbab. Special kimbab was tasty having little bit sweet taste in it as well, Tuna kimbab has taste of fish as it would be... Trying kimbab for the first time so, I just got satisfied. Soup was very tasty for kimbab and kimchi was a bit very sour( people who love sour would love it very much). I eat average sour so I found it very much sour . This place is mostly packed and busy but they serve you in time which is very good. This place would be best for kimbab, sour lover and cake lovers."
5,"The food is very good . I love the atmosphere, service and food good job"
5,Best among all the other places I've tried.
5,"I have been here more than 50 times. The staff here are so sweet. The food is 10 out of 10. Once you go here and start liking the food, there's no going back the amount of money that I spend here is insane."
5,Love it!
5,Fav place for gimbap.
5,Good quality and tasty gimbaps for the price point. No brainer for a quick bite
5,"I have only tried kimbap there which i must say is better than all other places. The price is good and also the portion is bigger than at other place. Plus it is run by korean family, so it's authentic too."
5,"My goto place when im craving some kimbap. The chicken kimbap is my favorite here. And i would say the best in town for the price as well.

I like the peach ice tea here as well.
Overall for the price this place offers you really good food."
5,"the strong point of this cafe is that it is run by local koreans and their food is not only scrumptious but also so affordable. the ambience is also nice, a good spacious cafe with pretty wall paintings. even their special mix kimbap is only Rs. 370 which makes them wayyyy affordable than other restaurants. best place for kimbap. they also offer delicious cupcakes "
5,one of the best kimbap i had in lalitpur. fast service and friendly owner. RECOMMEND!
5,"You NEED to try this place--seriously, don't walk, RUN! This is hands down the best and most authentic kimbap I've ever had (and I've had plenty).

The staff is incredibly kind, service is quick, and the best part? The owner is Korean, so you know you're getting the real deal. The menu is simple--kimbaps, cupcakes, and drinks--but they also sell a container of radish kimchi for 290. Plus, they make their own kimchi!

The space is warm and welcoming, and I've already been twice--I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. It's a hidden gem in Jhamsikhel, especially popular among school kids. My only wish is for them to expand the menu a bit--maybe add kimchi fried rice, cabbage kimchi, bibimbap, tteokbokki, fish cakes, and some Korean desserts. But honestly, it's already perfect.

The kimbap portions are generous and super filling, served with a side of radish kimchi and a soul-soothing soup (not sure what kind, but it's amazing). If you love Korean food, this spot is a must-visit!"
4,"Kimbaap here is extremely fresh and delicious and the side dishes are equally good. Also, the place is clean and cozy. Definitely a must  visit if you're a kimbaap lover."
5,"We just tried kimbap, strawberry lemonade, iced peach tea, red velvet muffin and mocha muffin here and it was worth it. The atmosphere is very good . Very much recommended for kimbap lover . Delicious kimbap and the service is also fast too. "
4,The service was instant. Place itself was very clean and food we ordered were of good taste. I liked their cupcakes more than I thought.
4,I absolutely loved the tuna kimbab here. Kimbab chai no doubt its the best hereI found this red velvet cupcake abit dry.Other than that its good.
4,"Good place for gimbap, and a little korean family runs the place and they are sweet and to the point."
5,If you are kimbab lover then cafe hessed is definetly the best place where you can have best gimbab. I visit there often and Tuna Kimbab is my favourate.
5,"I've had a Veg Kimbap, it was good."
4,I didn't really get the hype for this place. The food were mostly bland and bakery items were overly priced.
4,"Beautiful, cozy and clean space with good food and cakes. Friendly staff. You do have to pay while ordering at the counter. Try any gimbap, it's really good!"
4,Simple menu and yummy kimbab in town! Radish kimchi is delicious! Muffins are delicious. They should more to the menu.
5,"Fast service, Chicken Kimbab was good."
5,Gimbap is too good
5,"Delicious cupcake, doughnuts and Kimbab"
3,Nice place to visit.
5,very yummy yayy
4,"The cafe is cute and cosy for dates, meets with friends and sometimes even alone. The Korean vibe makes it really good and the owners are very friendly. This is my go to place for chicken kimbap and their hessed special one is also unique and tasty. I love the side broth and pickled anchovies. The cupcakes are also very nice.
Yet again it was the best and most authentic chicken gimbap. Cafe hessed never fails to impress me. The new extension has made it more spacious.
Buff kimbap turned out to be as good and delicious.
I will not consider tuna kimbap as good as other ones."
4,"out of the blue i went for their kimbap, I'm delighted i did, now i am hooked. tried all of their offerings chicken, tuna, buff and veg kimbap, all are good. they provide kimchi with it too. they have a few options of cupcakes as well and all are just wow. this place is run by koreans and they are very hospitable. this place is highly recommended even if you don't like korean food, this will change your mind."
5,"Food was amazing. Served extremely quick, within minutes of ordering. Atmosphere is quiet and peaceful."
5,The best place to eat kimbab in k-town. I would recommend it if you are a Korean food enthusiast.
5,"Best chicken kimbap I've ever had Service also pretty quick and the owners are very sweet and friendly! Love this place,food and the cozy vibes"
3,Good ambience
2,Worst food. Conjusted parking space
5,good place
4,Good location but parking wasn't enough
5,"We recently hosted our corporate event at Maxims Banquet & Events, and it was a seamless experience from start to finish. The venue offered a spacious, well-equipped hall with modern amenities, ideal for professional gatherings. The ambiance was elegant yet functional, perfect for presentations, networking, and team celebrations."
1,"Had attended a program and the food was tasty with deep fried chicken and all. However, had to throw up at night, and throwing up is very rare to me. That's a shame and there had be concerns regarding food of this place in previous reviews, nevertheless, I got to experience it first hand yesterday!"
1,"We went for a bratabanda party and  ambience was fine but the food was ridiculous. Cheese pakauda , only the flour was deep fried we can't even smell that and paneer masala  ,whole paneer was smelling like ketchup sauce with sour taste . And every other item we're below average.Never had this kinda terrible experience with food at  partypalace ."
3,The food was good but the place is very small. The service was average.
3,"Ambience is good. Dinner space seems a bit bland without vibrance and needs some decor.
During my visit last time, snacks was good but in dinner, the chixken tandoori was very poorly cooked.
Please check food before being served."
4,Nice one
2,It is mostly useful for small gatherings like birthdays and small celebrations. It cannot cater to the larger population.
5,Good party venue
4,Good Place Good Food and Well trained Staff
5,"Had wedding+reception at Maxim in March 2025 with ~200 guests.
- My point of contact was Ms Sakshi from Sales/Marketing, and my coordination with her was excellent.
- Any changes and updates I requested were noted and executed well by Maxim. Not once I had to repeat.
- Not once did I have to do any 'kach-kach' with management staff, nor the food-service workers. Things went smooth.
- The place is ideal for 200-300 guests if there's a wedding. I am not sure about more. I had ~200 guests; so it was spacious and parking was not an issue.
- The buffet lunch's taste/quality met my expectation. The snacks' exceeded my expectation. My family and guests were very happy with food.
- Restroom was clean enough. The outdoors seating area, and the halls were cleaned very well before my party.
- Not a cheap place but isn't expensive either; the price was very reasonable considering it's in Kupondole. It was value for money.
- They even refund the booking fee, in case you cancel the party due to death / 'jutho'.
- I didn't ask them for any unreasonable accomodations during the event; I kept my end of the bargain, and they kept theirs.

I had a very, very satisfactory experience at Maxim.

Note1: Have your family and relatives take away left-over buffet and snacks after the party is over.
Note2: Be mindful to tell them what you want, what your timings are.
Note3: If some of your guests arrive pretty late while you have already okay'd closing the food, or that the banquet refuses to extend the agreed-upon time, it's not the banquet's fault. So don't be pissed at staff. We should expect them to provide good service, while we should act as good customers."
5,"We had our wedding reception at Maxims Banquet, and it was amazing. The venue was beautiful, with excellent service and a stunning atmosphere. The food was outstanding--delicious, well-presented, and enjoyed by all our guests. Overall, a memorable experience that made our day perfect. Highly recommend!"
5,"Excellent banquet service, amazing banquet staff and fantastic food!
Cleanliness of the hall and restrooms were very good. Overall a perfect place for any kinds of events and gatherings.
2"
5,We enjoyed alot here ! Great hospitality
1,"""I had a deeply disappointing experience at Maxims Banquet. The wedding event I attended was extended by a couple of hours, and the staff was quite unaccommodating. They began packing up the food in plastic bags while guests were still arriving to greet the couple, leaving many without a chance to eat. We thought there was the next event after our function but there was no such event after ours. I don't know why were they in such a hurry to pack food in plastic bag. This lack of consideration felt extremely rude, especially for such an important occasion. Everyone should think one before attending or doing any events here."
2,"Poor service and Staffa  are unresponsive. The ambiance looks quite old and needs renovating. A few of the food containers were empty and asked for a refill but the staff didn't respond properly. Seemed like they didn't even bother to refill the food. Also, the  parking is very limited and parking is a bit of an issue."
4,Nice place
5,This banquet is quite reasonable with a good ambience. It has a capacity of over 100 plus people. The price of food and booking of hall is also low in comparison to others.
5,It was too goo for everything
5,Nice hospitality

3,"This banquet has good space for organising family functions like marriage.
It has adequate parking space.
Food is good enough."
1,"CCTV cameras are only part of decoration.
Don't hope to get any kind help from them in case of any lost items."
2,"Food was awful except the fruits and desert. Unmanaged service, parking and cleaners, Outdoor and BBQ ambience was A+ tho."

And Mr.promad CEO of Kumari Boutique Hotel send me and my friend to the airport it's very comfortable really thank you "
5,"Questo hotel e fantastico! Il valore aggiunto e rappresentato senza dubbio dal personale estremamente gentile e accogliente. In particolare modo le 2 ragazze della reception sono di una dolcezza disarmante, dispensano consigli utilissimi su tutto cio che puo servire e che puo essere vantaggioso agli ospiti e fanno realmente sentire accolti come mai mi ero sentito in nessun altro hotel in cui sia stato in vita mia. Oltre a cio, la struttura e situata in una stradetta tranquilla e silenziosissima e, al tempo stesso, super centrale. Infatti a piedi si gira tutto il centro facilmente nelle strade piu belle. La camera e bellissima e accogliente"
5,"Very quiete hotel in the middle of Thamel. Rooms are comfortable and ours had a great view.
Breakfast is partially buffet, but some things can be made to order."
5,"spent 4 days in this hotel. It is really cozy and homey place.
I also want to mention a staff name Rosy. She is so heartwarming and enthusiastic receptionist. She always greeted to me every single time we met and ask me how's the day. Also she would recommend lots of nice place to me and answer so many questions that I asked. And also she give me more knowledge in the king of Nepal. I feel so grateful for everything she has done. Thank you Rosy and thank you all the nice staff here.i really recommend this hotel.
Next time when I make plan to holiday in Nepal I will absolutely go there. Thank you all of Kumari beutique team,,"
5,Es war ein super Aufenthalt vor und nach unserer Wanderung hier. Das Personal und vor allem Rosi war so warmherzig und kommunikativ. Es war uns eine grosse Freude hier ein paar Nachte zu verbringen. Jederzeit wieder!
5,"Kumari was an excellent hotel. A super comfortable bed, a large spread for breakfast, on a quiet street near the edge of Thamel. If you want to stay in Thamel it's an idea place to stay for a quiet night. Personally, I'm not sure I'd choose Thamel next time, but if you want Thamel it's a great spot."

I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Kathmandu!"

The staff were incredibly polite, attentive, and always ready to help. The food was delicious, and every meal was a delight.

Highly recommended for a comfortable and memorable stay."

Outside environment is good, especially the tidy and quiet room, helping me to have a good sleep and stay in Nepal. The highlight of this hotel is the service, very considerate and very friendly people. The most impressive part for me is that Pasang and Rosy are sooooo nice, taking good care of my stay in Kumari, make me feeling like at home. I would say they are professional, kind and always help me a lot. I really enjoy the stay here in Kumari."

5,"""Kind, welcoming, clean, comfortable, friendly, professionally run, and a joy to return to"". All these are accurate descriptions of the Kumari Boutique Hotel in Kathmandu.
My husband first came across this hotel as we started to come out of lockdown in 2021 and has returned there ever since. I was fortunate enough to visit the Kumari Boutique Hotel twice in 2023 and then twice again in 2024.
On my first visit in October 2024, both my husband and I were ill, having picked up a virus whilst travelling in India. The wonderful owner and his staff could not have been kinder, and on the second day we asked for a Doctor to visit my husband. We are so grateful to everyone for their kindness to us as my husband was quite ill.
The rooms are kept spotlessly clean by the excellent Housekeeping Team and the food in the hotel is also very good. Breakfast at the Kumari Boutique Hotel is one of the highlights of our visits and the front of house team are extremely friendly and helpful. They make you feel like you are the only person staying in the hotel and that nothing is too much trouble.
My only concern in writing this review, is that the hotel will be fully booked next time we visit Kathmandu!"

5,A great place to stay if you like to live close to Kathmandu square. The hospitality is superb and the service was excellent. I was traveling alone but I felt like home with the friendly staff here.
5,"Waren zum zweiten Mal hier. Ein sehr angenehmes kleines Hotel, dass viel Wert auf Sauberkeit, Hilfsbereitschaft und guten Service legt."
5,"Small and cosy hotel situated in a rather quiet corner of Thamel. Large, nice and clean rooms, exceptionally friendly and helpful staff and very fair prices made us come back after 2019 and again we very much enjoyed our stay."
5,2024 Aralik ayinda burada 6 gece kaldik.Otel unlu thamel caddesine sadece bes dakika uzaklikta.Otelin calisanlari cok kibar ve yardimsever.Odalar tertemiz ve ihtiyaciniz olan her sey var odalarda .Sabah kahvaltisi hem Avrupa hem Asya mutfagi olarak hazirlaniyor.Kahvaltida her sey gunluk ve taze.Ayni zamanda otel size gideceginiz turlar konusunda da cok yardimci oluyor .Tekrar Katmandu'ya gelsem hic dusunmem tekrar kalirim .
5,Great quiet location around the corner from the highlights of Thamel neighborhood. Outstanding service and very comfortable rooms. Nice breakfast. We loved our stay here and would choose it again.
5,"Well deserved 5 stars. I stayed here for a couple nights after trekking and it was such a warm welcoming experience. Staff are friendly and literally quick to respond to any and all needs. I asked for a room with sunlight since I might be spending a lot of time resting and got a room on the 4th floor with a gorgeous view of trees and skyline. The room itself was clean, great bed, great water pressure, all needs met. The staff arranged private car transport to the airport for less than other hotels had done for me, and when they realized there was something happening in town which might cause traffic to be worse, they called to let me know so we could leave earlier. Such attention to detail and caring about their guests. Also, there's a luggage scale to weigh which is incredibly helpful. Will stay again when I return to Thamel."
5,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Kumari and it was an absolutely fantastic experience! From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, making me feel right at home. The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed. The hotel's location was perfect--close to major attractions like Durbar Square and Thamel, yet tucked away enough to offer a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.

I also appreciated the thoughtful touches, such as complimentary water, and the availability of travel assistance for tours and transportation."
5,"We recently stayed at Kumari's and we couldn't be more pleased with our experience. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly warm and polite, they offered us great recommendations for local things to do around. The location of the hotel is perfect and the breakfast was delicious, I looked forward to it every morning lol. Room service was excellent and they also offer laundry services. I would highly recommend it if you're visiting Kathmandu :)"
5,"Susses kleine Familiengefuhrtes Hotel, tolles Fruhstuck und sehr nette Menschen - absolut zu empfehlen!"
3,"Stayed in a suite for 3 nights. Positives were the location, WiFi and staff members. Negatives: Breakfast was not varied or good. 3 bulky chairs in room which made the suite more crowded than anything."
5,"Amazing! The staff are phenomenal, they helped us purchase plane tickets to get us to pokhara, we had laundry done and the rooms are very nice and clean , it's at the end of the alley so you don't hear so much of the noise from thamal! Very nice hotel and I can't wait to come back!!"
5,Et dejligt roligt og hyggeligt hotel lige uden for Thamels kaos. Det har lyse vaerelser og en dejlig stemning. Personalet er hjaelpsomme og meget venlige. Vi vendte tilbage til hotellet flere gange mellem vores udflugter ud af Kathmandu.
5,"Totally well-deserved 5 stars! This hotel is safely and quietly tucked away in a small alley, walking distance to everything Thamel has to offer.

Very friendly and attentive reception and operational staff who make you feel like home. Manager is always around to supervise. Rooms are spot clean and well-designed for functional use.

Highly recommended for a short stay in Kathmandu!"
5,"We stayed there for 4 nights. Starting from checkin to checkout everything was super smooth. The location was perfect, in the thamel area but in a quiet lane. The hotel staffs, all of them, are always smiling and willing to help you to the maximum extent possible. We would like to return here everytime in Kathmandu. Food in hotel is decent. Hot water available at perfect temperature. The breakfast spread was adequate."
5,"Stayed here first two nights in Kathmandu! Can't fault it! Super friendly staff , good service 
Super buzzing markets next door , and loads of nice places to eat. Walkable to Kathmandu square but very very busy buzzing streets as so close to the market. Nice experience before my gateway to Pokhara and trekking :) 
Didn't take many photos , sorry"
5,"Wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Thamel! I wish we could've stayed more nights it was so lovely. It had the whole package of great value in terms of price, cleanliness, and staff kindness. It was tucked away in Thamel, so it was peaceful, and yet close to everything. Highly recommend!"
5,"This hotel is the best in the heart of the city. The breakfast was delicious, and the room service was excellent. The hotel manager is very polite and friendly, always ready to assist guests with anything they need."
5,"My friend and I stayed in a double twin room. It was clean comfortable and had everything we needed. The staff were so polite and kind. They helped us with all our questions, arranged a private car for the day, and explained Nepali culture. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely go back."
5,"Truly the best hotel I have stayed at in Kathmandu, and in terms of the service, it's the best hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff go exceedingly above and beyond to accommodate, and are extraordinarily polite, gracious, and friendly in their demeanor and treatment. The rooms were cleaned frequently and throughly; the bed was so comfortable, the windows huge and the curtains black-out, greatly enhancing the quality of our sleep. The shower water had intense pressure and could run so hot it steamed the bathroom up in just a short time, while the AC blew frigid cold if we needed it too. The room service food was excellent, with a wide variety, and the included breakfast was both tasty and healthy! But again, it was the staff that made this place amazing. Just as a specific example: One gentleman here brought a heavy piece of luggage all the way down the road to where my parents were staying! That's a favor that was neither for his guest, nor his hotel, that was just him being an upstanding and hospitable person! They have hired the right people here and we are grateful! We will most certainly be back!"
5,"I only stayed here one night but we had a wonderful dinner, excellent service (so friendly!), and had our breakfast packed kindly for an early flight. The room was really clean and tidy, with all the amenities. Would certainly recommend if in Kathmandu."
5,Courteous staff
5,"nice service, great view"
5,"This hotel is very comfortable with amazing staff. The rooms are well climate controlled, comfy beds, nice showers. The restaurant has delicious food at good prices. And the staff are so kind and helpful you feel like you're a treasured guest the whole time. The location at the edge of Thamel means there a little noise still, but much less than in the heart of the Thamel, and minimal street sellers. Yet it's still an easy walk to the Thamel attractions and reasonable enough for taxis to pick up and drop off for further distances. The area is clean and green, a great front porch to relax on with masala tea after a day of exploring. Highly recommend!"
5,I truly enjoyed my stay here. I booked this room to decompress after my 50+ hour trip from the States to Kathmandu before making my way to Dhulikhel. The airport transfer that I arranged with the hotel was a breeze. It's at the very end of the street which can appear a bit scary when walking alone at night but the place itself was beautiful. Breakfast is included and the food was delicious. The room looked better in the pictures but it was still cute and cozy. The staff were friendly and helpful! Would highly recommend staying here.

5,"We had a wonderful stay at Kumari! Our room was very clean and updated with modern amenities and the breakfast (included) was DELICIOUS. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and the location was excellent as it was quiet at night while also close (within walking distance) to Darbur Square and the royal palace (both highly recommended). It is also across from a coffee shop with really good coffee! Kumari Hotel is a small, very sweet place to stay and I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,"#beautifull garden

5,"The environment was wonderfully relaxing and clean, and the staff were very friendly."
5,Hotel with nice ambience. Right in the middle of Thamel which is brooming with life. A tourist shipping area.
4,Eco is a great place for a stay.  The staff is what makes the place. They are so welcoming and helpful.
5,Great place!   Extremely clean rooms.   The area of Kathmandu is nice with tons of shopping areas nearby.  The staff is also very helpful especially Bikash and Rojina.  Would definitely stay again!

5,"It was perfect eco resort. With friendly ECO behaviour. Well suggested. Specially the ""Sweet Room"""
5,"Nice rooms, great staff and located centrally"
5,Nice
5,"We visit hotel after our Mera expedition, and we were looking for a quite chill place and that was exactly this place. Its relaxing to just sit outside without any street noise...
Food was ok, actually delicous, and important ! : any belly problems :)
Yes rooms could be better but for our needs it was ok (week before we slept in a tents :D )"
4,"Stay at Thamel Eco Resort was satisfactory. Rooms were comfortable. All staff were very welcoming and special thanks to Pradeep. The location was ideal for exploring the near by sightseeing, shops and restaurants, making it easy to get around. I would recommend this property to anyone looking for convenient and comfortable stay in Kathmandu (Thamel)."
1,"I booked a deluxe room for one night on New Year's Eve through Agoda. When we arrived at around 7 PM, the staff (possibly the owner) at the reception informed us that the hotel was fully booked.

He offered us a room in a nearby hotel they also managed, claiming it was of the same quality. However, the other hotel was clearly lower in quality, and the room was much smaller. Later, he proposed a reduced price for this inferior room, but after being misled, we no longer felt comfortable staying there.

We requested a refund, but he insisted he couldn't process it until the next morning. Despite having access to our booking details via the email from Agoda, he didn't seem to check the transaction on his side. He never apologized and even said we were the problem. After 30-40 minutes of discussion, he finally refunded our money in cash, though it was done reluctantly."
1,"Der Standard meines Zimmers entsprach 0 Sternen. Kein Tropfen heisses oder warmes Wasser zum Duschen,  Bettwasche wurde nach dem letzten Gast nicht gewechselt, Haare und Flecken im Bett, Zimmertur zum Innenhof nicht sicher zu verriegeln, unangenehmer Geruch im Zimmer, kein Licht/Lichtschalter am Bett, sehr hellhorig. Dies alles entspricht nicht einem 3 Sterne Hotel in Kathmandu. Respektlos einem Gast ein solches Zimmer fur nicht wenig Geld zu geben obwohl es auch bessere (freie)
Zimmer im Haus gegeben hatte. Allerdings wurden ich darum betrogen. Keine Einsicht, keine Entschuldigung und kein Entgegenkommen von Seiten des Chefs. Auch meine nepalesische Trekkingagentur wurde sehr abweisend behandelt. Schade !
Kathmandu, November 2024"
1,"This hotel is very old ,  I call reception guy to look the A/c  ,He let me wait some hours hours first , ( EXCUSE ) he don't  want to change my room , he give me extra blanket , I book this hotel through Agoda, I request to everyone don't believe the false website Agoda is one of the worst online booking company. How much I pay it is useless , No good service .Around this hotel is one by one best and cheap hotels and good services."
5,It is a wonderful location for both meetings and lodging. Everything is conveniently close by.
4,"An oasis, in the heart of the controlled chaos, that is Kathmandu.  Its strongest asset is the hard-working staff. Who do all that they can to make the experience worthwhile."
2,"Pozaproshlom godu ostanavlivalis v etom otele, ponravilos. Reshili ostanovitsya v etom godu snova. Otel stal zametno huzhe. Eda srednyaya, v nomerah byla ne pomenyana postel. Pravda kogda poprosili pomenyat. Sdelali uborku nomera i pomenyali. V tualetnoy komnate  tozhe bylo ne ochen chis

Personal vpolne dobrozhelatelnyy. Edinstvennyy plyus eto mesto raspolozhenie otelya. Takoy malenkiy oazis v centre Tamelya. Vnutri nebolshoy sad.
V itoge my pereehali v drugoy otel."
3,Rooms are rather basic but clean and functional. Not exactly 4 star but reasonable.
1,"The only good thing about the place is that it is located in the heart of the market. It is surrounded by dance bars, so if you are from a reserved culture you may not like staying there. We booked a suite but it was nothing to the expectations. The TV was hanging, looked like it was about to fall. The bathtub gave my kid boils which took 5 days to clear. Also the water from bathtub came in entire bathroom as the outlet was not connected to drainage. The hotel staff was polite but the hospitality was very poor. The room had the smell of alcohol and cigarettes. The breakfast suitable for US tourist, but they made also paratha on request for us. We got cheated in paying more for the room."
5,The hotel room and services were great.We absolutely enjoyed our stay in the hotel .The location is also good
5,Stayed thrice. A very pleasant experience. Good service. A beautiful garden courtyard to relax and chill.
3,The staffs are very welcoming and sincere. The bathrooms were clean but the flash was not working. They can definitely improve the quality of the rooms.
5,Calm and peaceful place
5,"Polite staffs behaviour, peaceful environment.."

5,"What a surprise this place is! A real ShangRiLa in a busy city! My new home away from home! I'll be back again soon! 

""back again soon""?  This is my THIRD time staying here!  Thamel Eco Resort staff remember my name, my likes, and my style - They've gone out of their way to accommodate a cranky old man!

The resort is hidden behind the main street (a bit hard to find - you guys need a new sign!)  But once you're here, you'll love the two gardens - the always on duty staff, and the serenity one needs after battling with the street-life of Kathmandu.  I hardly feel like I'm in Kathmandu as I write this review -

Convenient shopping for gifts and necessities right outside the door.  I'm now looking for an opportunity to return - maybe become a live-in resident for a while!  Great place!

Need a refreshing beverage, or something to eat?  Bishal will see to your needs.  Anything else, Nabin will take care of you!"

4,Room is a little used and the rest was nice.
3,The location is great as it's in the middle of the market but the rooms were bad. Rooms have a sewage smell coming from the bathroom. I stayed there multiple times and all the rooms were like that. It has no elevator either. It's like you get what you pay for. We didn't have a choice for the hotel as it was part of our tour to EBC.
5,Awesome place to Dine in 
5,"Great Budget hotel, in the main market, staff is so friendly  Love from India"
5,An amazing place to stay . i like my stay here . everything is good ..and staff are very friendly and kind .Big shout out to Roshan And AJAYA very nice guy . clean and peaceful environment . highly recommend this hostel..number 1 in ktm.

5,Best hostel of Kathmandu with swimming pool and chilll public areas....THE BESTEST WOW 
1,"This is the pathetic place.
Don't come here.

People are not supportive here.

Ajay receptionist is a person who consider himself as a owner and treat you badly.

No fans, no curtains, no cleaning."
1,"Bad hostel in terms of service.
No curtains, no fan.

Ajay receptionist is very bad person.

Room service is very bad
On request they don't provide fan also."

5,"5-Star Experience at Alobar 1000 Hostel - Thamel

I had an amazing stay at Alobar 1000 Hostel in Thamel, Kathmandu, and would 100% recommend it to any traveler looking for a budget-friendly yet comfortable place with a great vibe!

From check-in to check-out, everything was perfectly on point. The staff is super friendly, helpful, and always smiling. They make you feel welcomed the moment you step in. The atmosphere here is warm, social, and filled with positive energy -- perfect for solo travelers, backpackers, or even groups.

 Clean rooms and bathrooms, hygienically maintained.
 Comfortable beds with clean linens.
 Common areas are vibrant -- perfect for relaxing, working, or meeting fellow travelers.
 The rooftop restaurant offers great food at reasonable prices with a chill ambiance and stunning views.
 Wi-Fi is strong and consistent, which is a big plus for remote workers.
 Location is prime -- right in Thamel, yet peaceful enough to enjoy a good night's sleep.

Only one minor issue -- the room had just a fan, which wasn't enough during the hotter parts of the day. A ceiling fan or better ventilation would make the room experience perfect. But honestly, with everything else being so well-managed, this was hardly a dealbreaker.

Overall, Alobar 1000 offers more than just a stay -- it offers an experience. Great people, perfect location, good food, and clean spaces. I'm truly grateful for the hospitality and the memories made here.
Ajaya was absolutely good in hosting
Highly recommended. Will definitely return!"
5,"Amazing people.  Place very clean, Easy Life.  I came and Will come back again."

5,"An Unforgettable Stay at Alobar1000 
Staying at Alobar100 was one of the most heartwarming and enriching experiences of my trip. The hostel has a relaxed, welcoming vibe that instantly makes you feel at home. It's more than just a place to sleep -- it's a community.

What truly sets Alobar100 apart are the people who run it. Every single staff member was kind, approachable, and genuinely caring. A special shoutout goes to Ajaya and Aasish -- two incredible souls who went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and memorable. Their warmth and hospitality reflect the very spirit of Alobar100.

If you're looking for a place with good energy, helpful people, and a peaceful yet social atmosphere, Alobar100 is the perfect spot. Highly recommended, and I can't wait to return."

""This hostel is the most budget-friendly and affordable.""
Thx Ajaya, Mountainmonk, Phattastha, Pasang Dolma, and all the others were truly wonderful people -- so kind, warm, and welcoming.
*Muhamnad Peace Sindhi*"
5,"Alobar1000 hostel was my first hostel experience and it was amazing. Those who know Kathmandu know that it is usually dusty but in Alobar they cleaned everywhere every day. The rooms, common areas, toilets were spotless. Everyone who worked there was very kind, smiling and helpful. Especially Ajaya and I are still in contact as friends. The cuisine is extremely delicious and we brought Turkish coffee from Turkiye and they even let us cook it. The memories I shared there and the friendships I made are unforgettable. Thank you very much for opening such a place. I feel very lucky to be with you there. I will definitely come again  It is a wonderful experience to have such different cultures and to be able to meet at the same point and see the valuable sharing of souls."

5,"What an amazing hostel. Clean, well-run and super easy to book tours through. good value for money, and so easy to meet others. The staff are really friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is a nice touch and special thanks to one staff member, Ajay, a very kind person."
5,"I've stayed in 3 hostels in Kathmandu and I really enjoyed this one. The staff is incredibly accommodating: Ajaya, Sunaina, Arjit have all be so kind, as is everyone. The bathrooms/beds have been the best of any hostel i've stayed. Plus there's free lockers to lock your gear, there's many hangout spots, cheap alcohol for a quick pre game before hitting the town, and great location in Thamel. I would stay here again!"
5,"Ajaya is an amazing admin in Alobar 1000 Hostel: cheerful, helpful, communicates well, capable to make things done.

If you have a problem - Ajaya will find a way to solve it.

Thank you, Ajaya!"
4,"I recently stayed at Hotel Alobar1000 and had a great experience overall. The location is perfect--right in the heart of Thamel, yet tucked away just enough to offer some peace and quiet. The staff was incredibly friendly and always willing to help, whether it was arranging taxis, suggesting local spots, or simply chatting about travel."
5,Amazing I came for two days and stayed for a week. Everything was brand new and super clean. The staff was wonderful. The beds were comfortable and the water was really hot. I was able to leave my belongings during the trek for free.
5,"A PERFECT PLACE FOR YOUR BIG DAY.
This was an awesome experience. Fantastic services by The Alobar Team and Mr. Ajaya for his efficient coordination and all time availability. Loved the services , the decor and the location. Thanks a lot to the hostel's staffs. Highly recommended. I'm if you want to make your event memories to be your one of the best days ."
5,"It is an excellent hostel. Rooms are well maintained , food is very delicious , good service by the staff & they are polite and friendly. Ajaya helped me with everything, Thank you Ajaya and the team .
Will be coming back."
5,One of the best hostel in ktm .
5,"Everything was perfect, good room, good bathroom and good staff
Thanks ajaya and all the team"
5,Ajaya welcomed me in on my first time staying here in Kathmandu. Comfy clean and cheap rooms which provide such good value for money. Would highly recommend
5,"This is my fourth time staying at Aloobar Hostel, and it's a nice place overall. The staff is friendly, especially Ajaya--the only name I happen to remember from there. The hostel has a small swimming pool, which was the best recovery for me after trekking. It's also located close to Thamel, and there's a rock climbing wall less than 50 steps away on foot."
5,"Number 1 hostel in Kathmandu. The staff is very friendly and feels like family. The rooms are very clean and hygienic. Location is top. Highly recommend. Special shoutout to Ajaya, and Kishor, but honestly the entire team deserves a shoutout! The kitchen and food is also great. Will be coming back!"
5,"Real experience of living. As of today, I have been here for three weeks. The room is clean and cleaned at least twice a day. The environment is very good, with a swimming pool and a rooftop lounge area. My friend Ajaya is very enthusiastic and provides me with good service. I think the price is very cost-effective. I will continue to live until I leave Kathmandu. Everyone is welcome to come and experience it."
4,"The people managing the hostel are very helpful and friendly!
Ajaya at the reception and Kish with the travel desk were very helpful.

However the wifi at night can be quite slow, making it difficult to work or use it.
Overall, Great Stay!"
5,"Brilliant experience, good people, great service."
5,"A friendly hostel with common areas to hang out in, and attached restaurant, and a travel company to help organize your treks. Off the main streets of Thamel, which reduces noise at night."

The accommodation is clean and there is 24-hour hot water for showering. Ajaya at the front desk is very friendly. He greets me every time he sees me. If I have any problem, I will ask him to help me solve it."
5,"I had an amazing stay at this hostel! The atmosphere is great, the rooms are clean, and the location is perfect.

5,Very great place and very kind and friendly staff ready when you need help with everything
5,We had a lovely stay at this nice and clean hostel! Coming back from annapurna circuit and it was just the right place to get used again to the busy streets of kathmandu. Thanks again for hosting us! See you soon!!
5,"Home away from home! 

Every time I land in Nepal, I don't check for any options, I just show up at Alobar 1000.

No booking stress, no second thoughts, because I know Alobar will always have space for me. It's not just a hostel; it's my hostel.

And it's not just about a bed or a room--it's the people.

The entire team, from the front desk to the cleaning staff to the security guard, treat me like a brother, not a guest.

The warmth, the laughs, the little moments - this place is family, and I feel it every single day I'm here.

And speaking of family, they literally include me in their celebrations, whether it's a festival, a random rooftop gathering, or just one of those spontaneous moments that makes travel unforgettable.

Alobar isn't just a place to stay. It's a feeling. A chaotic, loving, welcoming hug disguised as a hostel.

So if you're reading this and planning to visit Nepal, don't even think twice. Just come to Alobar 1000.

Experience the warmth, the people, and the magic that makes this place unforgettable.

I'll be back next year. For longer. Again.
Because some places aren't just places, they're home! "
5,"good price,good enviroment in kathmandu"

5,Located at close proximity to Thamel market it's in perfect location cheap prices and staff is helpful they do accept inr as well and rooms and washrooms are clean and tidy
5,"One of the best hostels in Thamel! The place is exceptionally clean, with the staff cleaning the rooms, bathrooms, and toilets twice a day. The ambiance is very pleasant and quiet, making it a perfect spot to relax. It's the only hostel in Thamel with a swimming pool, though I didn't get a chance to jump in. The staff are amazing--especially the three ladies at the front desk, the night watchman, and the cocktail maker (sorry, I forgot your names!).

Overall, I'd give it an 8/10. A small suggestion for the Alobar 1000 management: consider introducing some games or evening activities in the dining area, as you have a great space that could be used to bring guests together."
4,"I stayed couple of days there and tbh, it was my first time staying in a hostel abroad which i really enjoyed it =) everyone's really friendly over there and they have a nice common area to sit and relax."
5,"Ive spend there for almost over a month in total! They have a pool, nice clean rooms and super friendly staff. Also you can meet new friends easily and the food is really not bad! I can recommend the chilli-momos ;)
Thanks for the nice stay and I hope I will come back one day! :D"
5,"One of the best hostel I have been to in my whole life. The staff is so kind, the building in a really nice place, comfortable, really felt good and like home there. Everything is pretty clean and the food is delicious. TRY THEIR CHILI MOMO !! Thank you for everything"
5,"Loads of chill areas, great atmosphere and the breakfast is tasty."
5,"Alobar is an awesome place to stay - conveniently located in Thamel, it has a fab pool, awesome courtyard, good food and the staff are so helpful! We had a great experience :) Alobar organised our trek for us including guide and permits etc - Tashi was so easy to work with and our guide Narayan was the absolute best!"
5,Great Hostel! Very clean and nice people. Beds are comfy. Would come back!
5,The place is amazing and the price are also very cheap
5,"Clean and soft bed (with socket, storage box, and curtain for privacy). Hot water in shower. Professional person on check-in."
4,I liked everything except that the aunties that regularly clean the hostel always make disgusting sounds as if they want to spit but can't get the phlegm out of their throat. was staying in the common area and heard that alot. 
5,"I think this is the best place to stay in Kathmandu
Clean and hygienic
The staff is so helpful here"
4,"The zostel is good, rooms were clean and all the things were available with bathrooms being clean but the zostel manager did not really get me a tour of the zostel with the cafe and all. Cafe has its own timing of opening up and closing, its not 24*7 open."
5,"Very affordable and safe Zostel concept
Rooftop cafe must visit place "
4,"I appreciated that the bathroom was in the room and the bed was super comfortable.
I didnt like that the room was situated in the back, it must be closed to a generator or similar because during the night the noise was continuous and disturbing.
The place is great, i would recommend it to others, just another room different from 304"
5,"Good Location , Common room facilities may be improved,  Menu price overhyped.. otherwise a good stay"
5,"Zostel is a great hostel located in the heart of Kathmandu. It's a great place to stay if you're looking for a budget-friendly option that's still clean and comfortable. The hostel has a variety of room types to choose from, including dorms and private rooms. The dorms are spacious and well-lit, and the private rooms are clean and cozy. The hostel also has a common area with a kitchen, a TV, and a games room. There's also a rooftop terrace with stunning views of the city.

The staff at Zostel are friendly and helpful. They're always happy to answer any questions you have and help you plan your trip. The hostel also offers a variety of free activities, such as yoga room on the roof.

Overall, Zostel is a great place to stay if you're looking for a budget-friendly and friendly hostel in Kathmandu.

Here are some pros and cons of Zostel Kathmandu:

Pros:

-Clean and comfortable rooms
-Friendly and helpful staff
-Free activities
-Great location

Cons:

-Can be noisy at times (neighbours)
-Some rooms are small
-No elevator

Overall, I would definitely recommend Zostel Kathmandu to anyone looking for a budget-friendly and friendly hostel in Kathmandu."
5,Good
4,In Thamel
4,Nice place to stay
5,Zostel never disappoints :)
5,I just loved Zostel Kathmandu. People are too good and friendly
5,"The Wifi is top notch, I attended all my work calls without any issue.
Food is tasty, but slightly on the expensive side. You could go to Carpe diem, connected through the rooftop of Zostel and enjoy the same menu with a better view.
Common room: You could hide a dead body there, it's more silent than a hospital room. I dare anyone to tune the guitar there, the strings go out of tune within seconds.
The receptionists are helpful and happy to help you with providing any info."
5,"We had a good time in Zostel.
Nice rooms, good food and very kind stuff"
5,The best hostel in Kathmandu. Tops everything from food to rooms to servicing to a helpful and  friendly staff. Couldn't have asked for a better deal.
1,Not so friendly not so helping staff.
3,"Rooms are really great. We booked in 4 bed mix dorm.

Compared to other zostels that you will find ind india, vibe is slightly low. Interms of room its really good!"
4,"Nice rooms for good price.
Included restaurant is mildly expensive. Not allowed to bring alcohol."
5,"If u are a Bagpacker, zostal Is best For you...,the hotel is clean and provides u great hospitality.The zostel Staff is very helpful and will guide u throughout your stay.The hotel provides u almost every facilities from good rooms.Bathroom is just Ok.
The rooftop of hotel was great.wen i say food was great(i mean it :))Overall experience was awesome.I'll recommend this hotel for  Solo Travelers."
5,"Receptionist was very friendly and helpful, Much thanks to her & it was a good stay!"
5,"Zostels are well known for best ever stays experience and this one make you believe. Free wifi available, well maintained, clean and hygienic rooms and dorms, also provide best quality food in their restaurants, parking is available, staff is very kind and helpful. Affordable and easy to reach. Try once and it will be memorable stay."
5,"The place is just perfect for backpackers, afterall its Zostel and it definitely lives up to the hype. The dorms are reall clean and there is a sweet resto-bar attached to it which looks beautiful at night."
5,Always recommend to everyone...so much supportive staff Nima ma'am and Aanand from Nector by carpedian hotel guide me alot the information of surrounding ...
5,The Roof top Bar is Dope ! Best Stay. Nima is such a great host 
2,Rooms don't have Vibe.
4,"rooms are very small but clean, receptionist was friendly, they have a cafe too"
5,"Zostel Kathmandu is amazing.
Everyone is very cooperative and all the services provided them were perfect.
And also the food in their restaurant is super yummy.
Overall if you are looking for a budget stay in Kathmandu... this is the best option you can go for."
1,Not recommended at all
5,"Food place is very good.
Beds are clean and spacious.
Overall a very good experience!
The place is clean and well maintained"
4,"Not in the league of great hostels like the one at pokhara but decent enough. Soft bed and 24x7 hot water was awesome af. Common room is quite cozy at night.

Have lunch at Roadhouse Cafe. Their pizzas are mouth watering and the best in nepal. Just ask for the pizza to be served on ceramic plate rather than aluminium one."
2,The Reception Girl (short hair) is not friendly. She don't even greet and smile. There should be a friendly atmosphere at hostel. It's boring !
4,"The hostel was very very comfortable and the staff was amazing, I was extremely sick and was taken care of really well. There's no kitchen and the common area isn't really maintained that well so if you're thinking it's social, nope."
4,"Amazing experience!  Although The wifi is quite slow though, not ideal if you are on a workcation or something."
4,"Decent all round experience. Second time staying. The service has dropped a little.

Unfortunately we got a private room right next to the kitchen, the noise and smells filled our room during service hours!"
4,Very close to the z-street and the hostel is manageablely clean to stay for the visit
5,Have always loved zostel and loving this Katmandu one as well
3,"We wanted to pick a safe bet and went for Zostel for a budget stay for few days of our stay - the location was thamel - it was good considering, there was peace and quiet and absolute commercial area in 5 mins walking distance - however, it's in a very small alley so we had to walk our luggage for some meters.

The rooms were okay, beds were cozy, what was a let down were the bathrooms. They have GOT TO upgrade the tiles, the fittings - eventhough it's a hostel, we'd expect some more than basic amenities and cleanliness.

There's a small cafe within the premises which was decent."
5,This place is really awesome. I have been staying at zostel for past 5 years and it never gets boring. New volunteer amrutha is really nice and friendly!!!! Will visit again soon!
1,The staff Raj needs to learn how to communicate with guest and other people. My guest almost missed a flight due to his un-cooperative attitude.
4,The rooms are nice and budget friendly but the price of food is bit high.
3,Limpio y en pleno Thamel. Faltaba un poco de ambiente y estaban renovando el rooftop cuando estuvimos nosotros. La habitacion doble delux era decente calidad-precio
5,"Zostel kathmandu has been d best experience amongst all d zostels we hv stayed so far in....
Food was just awsm n so wer all d ppl managing it"
3,"The photos posted seems to be very old, now the place looks quite old and there is no common room as of now. Private room photos looks very nice but actually room is very small and give boxy feeling. Room's window glass was broken and it was just like that. I don't think that's gonna fix soon.

Staff and everyone was very helpful."
5,"I will definitely suggest zostel to anyone who visits Kathmandu. Other than the beautiful and ancient Kathmandu. Zostel was a place I also liked. Great people, I made some friends as well. Overall great!!"
2,"Not sure why so highly rated.

Go next door to Flock Hostel, their bar is actually open and has live music videos!

I felt ripped off..they are the same cost of rooms if not cheaper, cleaner and safer as they have room keys.

Manager is rude here"
5,"This was great, feel at home, very Accommodating staff, very neat and clean, thanks to Pooja and Ashmita sister."
1,"they have one hundred methods to produce noisy
also make me up in 8am
cleanness construction trash-falling,etc.
PS:I stayed here for one month and lazy to move another one"
5,Experience is amazing. Lady at reception very helpful. Staff is super supportive. Bunk beds are also super amazing. Entire property is very clean. Vibes are also amazing. Amazing place for staying in Kathmandu. All places are nearby. Food is also great there in theri own cafe. So Really Happy to be there. Highly recommended.

5,Excellent
5,"Its good experience with hotel. The hotel is in prime located , staffs are well mannered, breakfast is well furnished, its so pleasant experience as home away from home. Thanks for entire team for my pleasant stay."
5,Great hotel with good food and amazing hospitality
5,"A 4-star hotel located in Thamel area of Kathmandu and is 15 mins away from Tribhuvan International Airport. It is one of the grandeur collosal hotel in Kathmandu. A welcome drink was giver before check-in. The lobby and reception desk is a bit spacious. There is a bar and above it is a portrait of the former Nepalese royal family. The rooms are small having basic amenities live TV, bathroom, double bed etc. The corridor is narrow. It has an outdoor pool, spa, conference room, travel desk, a dining area, an elevator, free WiFi etc. It also has a small fountain and a small parking space. The hotel service was good. Many local as well as foreign tourists stay at this hotel. Overall, had a pleasant and a relaxed stay at this hotel."
1,"I've never felt so unsafe before in a hotel, and I've stayed in some one-star guesthouses and hostels and those are even better than this. At 8am in the morning, on my bed, I could hear someone with card trying to enter my room and they tried few times and even tried to push the door. As a female traveler, I always double lock my door. After 5 minutes, I went to check through the hole, and there was a man and a housekeeping lady. I opened the door and asked what's wrong. The man was just laughing nervously and said it's a mistake. I went down to the reception and the lady told me there was a misunderstanding and they thought that was a room that has checked out so they wanted to clean it. I could understand the ""mistake"" but surely the housekeeping team can double check with the supervisor when they realize that the door is locked from inside, instead of trying to forcefully open the door (at 8am) with the help of another man. Imagine if I haven't double locked the door, things could have gone worse. Safety has always been my main priority, and this hotel definitely doesn't seem to prioritize that. Plus, this is an old hotel, from the lift, bathroom, and towels. With the same amount of money, you could've done yourself a good favour and stayed somewhere better and safer than this hotel."
1,"The worst hotel. We came back from a long trek only to find lukewarm water for a shower. The front desk personnel knew very well about lukewarm water and showed no emotions to our complaint.

Also, the air conditioner is set to show 23 degrees, but it is running as a slow fan only. None of the compressors in any of the rooms is functional. Try opening the window and listening to the compressor sound from any of the rooms. There is none.

The bathroom cleanliness is subpar. Overall a very bad hotel to stay."
1,"Very old hotel, incompetent staff. Nothing works here, whether it's the door keys, phones, tv, flush doesn't work. Everything's old and smelly, roaches in rooms, nasty bathrooms. Breakfast is a joke. Only plus point is great location. Avoid!!"
5,"I stayed a total of 14 nights at this hotel and I'm really impressed with the service I received. Every morning when I went down for the buffet breakfast, which offered a variety of options, I'd be greeted with smiles by the kitchen staff. They really saw to my every need each morning. I like tea made a certain way and they made it each morning.  The management was also very friendly and attentive. I got a little sick, as many travellers to this country do, and they helped me find a remedy. My flight home was later in the evening and I got an extra late checkout upon asking. All in all, it really was the staff as a whole that made my stay memorable and I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Nepal."

5,great service & good staff
1,"Fuyez !
Je pourrais faire une dissertation sur cet hotel. Je pourrais parler de la vetuste de la climatisation qui fait un bruit de tracteur qui n'arrive pas a demarrer,  de l'hygiene des draps pleins de poils ou des toilettes pleins de traces,  de l'eau froide de la douche,  de l'odeur de brocante de la chambre, des prises electriques qui font des etincelles des que l'ont branche quelque chose, de l'ascenseur qui est en fin de vie ...
Vraiment une horreur. Choisissez un autre hotel."
5,"It was very nice to stay here.. staff and services are more than the satisfaction ..

Thanks Hotel Vaishali for wonder stay at Thamel.."
5,Nice hotel to stay supportive staff food quality is good
1,"Worst !!! Worst !!! Worst
hotel ever
Within every 5 to 10 mins Electricity get cut
Room service is also very poor
Rooms are not big enough
Washroom is very congested & Hot water not easily available
They haven't give any cup, tea bags or coffee
We have to asked for it
Food is also very bad
A.C is also not working
Charging plug is also not working properly
I have booked this hotel by seeing 4star rating but after experiencing this horrible service i am shocked ,i have paid enough but didn't meet my expectations
Terrible experience"
5,Nice
5,"Good clean ammenities, friendly staff and good food."
5,Quality service with reasonable cost.
3,Very old hotel... Food is average.... breakfast doesn't have good options... thali is worth eating though... very humble and friendly staff... cooperative too... You can enjoy your stay here.
4,Ideale se vuoi vivere l'esperienza di Kathmandu nella zona piu storica
1,Pathetic hotel
5,"If location wasn't enough, the taste of the food and service of the staff is outstanding, they go an extra mile to make your stay p[leasureable, thanks for the care and hospitality"
5,The ambience was good and affordable stay.
3,We have taken three room. Rooms are ok but toilet ammenities are not ok. Pressure of water in bathroom taps are not proper. In some bath rooms taps are not available only shower is working.  Camod is so dirty and old. In evening assistance staff is not available.  Hotel shows 4 star but it is not so good as to be 3 star. Because after occupy the room if we face such problems it  make our mood off  and do not feel comfortable . Food quality and service is good. I request the management to pay attention on maintainance/ renovation.
2,"Hotel looks so nice and cool on the outside but inside its not as good as it looks.First the washroom toilets dont flush,AC isnt good,room is not fresh at all,no fridge to put your food overall i think this hotel could use some improvements."
5,"Great place to stay in Thamel! Medium range price, lovely staff, close to lots of good restaurants and shops and only short taxi to airport. We have stayed here 3 times now and have enjoyed each stay."
4,Very old hotel the pipes and fittings are broken otherwise the rooms are very clean.
4,Cockroach  in my room
4,Affordable for stay at Thamel

Thanks to Sunil and Ram for your nice service."
1,"One of my worst stays .
The shower is broken .....
The pool isn't clean ....."
5,Overall experience was really wonderful. If you are looking for a better price stay with a good food then you must have to try this property at least once. They are really having a very good hospitality and their staff is also really very good. Staff is supportive in all way whether us regarding commute to other places or if you got midnight cravings then they are really good to provide meals on time when you want.
5,Good 
5,Everything is excellent 
1,"Service is very Cheap,
Poor & cheap housekeeping,
No hot water in night time,
Food facility is very poor & breakfast service are cheap & taste less.
More are found electrical hazard which are dangerous for human life.
Pathetic & Cheap Service."
4,"Good hotel in Kathmandu, located in Thamel area,all facilities like stores,atms,forex etc. available in the surroundings, nice spacious rooms, staffs are helpful ,good behaviour, breakfast is also good."
1,"Our group of 20, including infants, had a terrible experience at Hotel.There was no hot water, making our night uncomfortable and forcing us to leave prematurely. The staff was indifferent to our problems, showing poor hospitality and making us feel neglected. This lack of basic amenities and care was unacceptable. We had to find another place in the middle of the night, causing great inconvenience, especially for the children. I strongly recommend avoiding this hotel to prevent a similar ordeal."
5,"We went in a group of 12 recently and 10 of them were senior citizens, everyone was amazed with the services of the hotel. The staff and the whole management was A-one. Everything was top notch. Each and every staff member were chivalrous and very respectful as well as responsive. We were provided with beautiful rooms with the pool view. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a lot of variety and on request demands were also accepted. Everything on their menu was delicious. Even the location of the hotel was very good. Everything was accessible within 200-300 meters and even some big shot places like lord of drinks was at walking distance. All 12 of us were extremely happy and satisfied with their services and we will definitely visit again. Special thanks to Mr. Rana for all the arrangements and letting us having a comfortable and relaxing stay. Kudos to Vaishali team "
1,such a disgusting hotel've ever visited in nepal
5,Finally Found an amazing place in Bhaktapur.
5,"Nous avons mange deux fois dans le restaurant Community at The Nanee tellement c'etait bon! L'equipe de serveurs Manjila et Kumar etaient super attentionnes  . Essayez leur Nanee signature cocktail, Trop bon!"
5,"It was a perfect place to eat after roaming around Bhaktapur on a sunny day. The quality of food is exceptional, the service staff were very warm and kind. I would definitely recommend it."
5,"Muy rico todo, el personal muy majo."
5,"I just love everything here!  The restaurant atmosphere is nice, the service is good and best the food is delicious!!! Personally I tried the carbonara and grill pork it's so good! A IPA draft beer is a must for the hot day!"

5,"Definitely more expensive than small ""local"" places, but the step up in quality of food and service was such a treat, after eating in tea houses for 2 weeks while trekking.  The chicken momos had such a light wrapper, and the filling had a great complex flavor.  The open face sandwich was very good too."
4,I've recently visited Community at The Nanee and I really enjoyed my time over there. The ambiance atmosphere and the overall environment is really well maintained and I have peace of mind over there. Food and beverage is good as well as well served. The staffs were so polite and respectful. I really enjoyed their hospitality. Overall experience is so good must visit if you tome around Bhaktapur Durbar Square area.
5,"Very cosy and hip place, secluded from the busy streets.

Very tasty food, very attentive staff. Very decent prices.

10/10, highly recommend."
5,"Great taste and quality Nepalese food, with excellent service, thank you! I wouldn't recommend Bhaktapur Durbar Square to anyone, but this restaurant was the highlight of the day."
5,"Heerlijk eten en goede bediening. Het restaurant is wat chique, voor EU10 pp lekker gegeten!"
4,"An extra 13% VAT was tacked onto the menu price, making the meal quite exorbitant. The Momo was absolutely delightful, but the tuna was a major letdown."
5,"Shao siGao iMu desugaFen Wei Qi moyokuNan Xing nosutatuhugaJi Min niDui Ying sareteimasita.

5,The nanee is basically a community based hotel which is opened in order to make the guest experience the newari  culture how the newari people of bhaktapur live their daily life .
5,"Simply loved this place:

- good food
- extremely courteous staff : both the servers were very hospitable, polite and made our experience a delight
- the place was clean : spic and span: tables, cutlery, dishes, overall restaurant everything clean!
- vibe : the place has a very soothing and peaceful vibe : very zen!"
4,Community at The Nanee is one of the youngest hotel and restaurants on the way at the narrow alley of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It is amazingly constructed bearing in mind about the Vastu Bigyan. The art and architecture has been creatively designed by Renowned Mr Manish Lal Shrestha Ji. The local food is so satisfying and the international cuisine has maintained its standard. The staffs are welcoming wit smile and namaste. The kitchen is clean. The rooms are designed according to price and and has maintained its standard. Amenities in the rooms are nature friendly
5,"This cozy, aesthetic spot is a peaceful retreat with authentic, flavorful food. The staff is warm and welcoming, making you feel right at home. Perfect for a relaxing meal!"
5,"We had our lunch here when walking around in Bhaktapur. The ambience, food quality and taste, service and staff - all is very good. Tried Nepali Thali Set (Veg) - all items were tasty, the best was yogurt."
5,"Bonne cuisine, service adorable. Bel endroit avec terrasse"
5,Lovely outdoor space for dinner. We had the traditional Newari set and it was fabulous and plentiful. Treat yourself!
5,We ordered 2 vegetarian dishes.  Both were excellent. Very good service
5,"Magical and cozy spot in Bhaktapur, one of the best places I ate in! The food was really good. I loved the homemade banana ice cream. The service was amazing, super kind and attentive to detail."
4,"Good location, well maintained within  a 4 star hotel.  A bit expensive but the food is good and tasty.  Worth trying while in Baktapur."
5,"Great place for a fancy lunch or dinner. We tried the traditional set and it was delicious. It is more expensive that most restaurants (we paid ~2,000 for two) but the place really worths it!"
5,We had a wonderful experience there earlier this evening. Such a charming and attentive waiter and the food was excellent.
1,"* added: To add to the insult, you charged me twice on my credit card. See picture.

You made a mistake by giving me chicken instead of fish in the Nepali rice set.

I don't eat chicken. So it's okay if you replace it but i then realized none of you knew whether it was chicken or fish that you were delivering. So I asked for paneer in replacement of the fish just to be safe... then the disaster began...

You told me there was no paneer. But minutes later, it turned out that there was paneer and you came back and said it would result in an extra charge. Indeed, the paneer set would be 100NPR more. So I expected to pay 100 NPR more. And then came the worst moment -- You ended up requesting 250NPR more for the additional paneer dish. Mind you -- I didn't touch the chicken and you took it back!

It's not a lot of money, but it was your mistake! And you were asking me for more money for your mistake???? What kind of restaurant is this? Your ruin your own business.

*to respond to your reply:
1 I asked for the manager;
2 it's not that I didn't like the fish. I didn't even know if you were serving me fish. Neither did your waiters - they couldn't tell. I had a bite and It tasted awful (I eat fish almost everyday). Because I can't eat chicken and you could not confirm, I asked for paneer as a replacement. To me it was your mistake and you should have corrected it instead of imposing additional costs on me - no matter how little.
3. Yes 250NPR was nothing at all. It's the way your team managed the problem."
5,"Cuisine d'excellence, faite maison avec des produits de qualite. La soupe de legumes est tres savoureuse, ainsi que le brownie au banana ice cream."
5,"The food was delicious!
The atmosphere of the restaurant is calm and relaxing, and the staff is smiling and welcoming.
We had the trio of dips, the pumpkin soup and the confit chicken, which were absolutely amazing."

5,One of the nicely designed cafe in Bhaktapur. Modern industrial design with best service. Perfect if you are looking to get away from busy road. Nice outdoor space too. Best and friendly service too.
5,"Incredible meal. This was easily one of the best meals I had in Nepal. Their curry was flavorful and kept making me want to get extra portions (which they offer). The different sauces and sides were interesting and enhanced the experience. Drink service was strong, and the service was experienced and polite. I would definitely recommend."
4,"Small restaurant/cafe with nice atmosphere, good service, delicious food"

5,A very good new place in Baktaphur. Modern   and nice menu
5,Sweet taste
4,"I recently visited Biryani Adda and tried their Chicken Dum Matka Biryani - and I must say, it was absolutely top-notch. The biryani was served in a traditional matka (clay pot), which not only enhanced the aroma but also kept the dish warm for a long time. Each spoonful had the perfect balance of spices, tender chicken, and fluffy, fragrant rice. The flavors were rich yet well-balanced, without being overly oily or heavy.

The portion size was generous, easily satisfying for a hearty appetite, and the presentation added to the overall experience. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring we were comfortable throughout our meal.

Another plus point is free parking, which is a big convenience in busy areas and makes the visit much smoother. The ambiance is casual yet pleasant, making it a great spot for both family dinners and casual meetups with friends."
4,Dispite of some things food was really delicious and mostly the service was great. People due to some misunderstandings i Had to change the review sometimes it's a human error but most important the food was great and the people are super understanding and thank you for this amazing biryani it's the best biryani around kkkathmmanndu lalkitpur and bhaktapur thankyou

4,On the pricy side but tastes good 
1,"Want to have dinner. Ordered biriyani.(online)

All items taste so bland.

Quantity was super low according to the price. Not even sufficient for one person. The taste was so mediocre. Even if we cooked at home it would taste better.

I would not recommend it. 0.5 star."
1,"I was craving indian food so I ordered from this restaurant and it would be an understatement if I tell that the food was bad because it was HORRIBLE. I had ordered chicken tikka masala, naan and tawa roti which cost me around Rs 800. Since the price was quite high, I thought the portion of the chicken would be more. Even the picture on their advertisement showed a decent picture of the chicken tikka masala. The outcome on the contrary was totally different it looked nothing like how they have advertised. Even the chicken pieces were only 3 in number and the curry was oversalty and wayy to oily. Do you want to kill your customers by feeding that much oil? Plus I cannot explain how it made me feel after eating it. I couldn't even eat it all so I threw it after few bites. Never going to eat anything from there ever."
4,Taste wise perfect but less quantity
1,My biggest mistake in life was ordering from  pathao and  The worst chicken biryani order from this place. Very bad taste as it was expensive. It's like fried rice not a Hadi biryani.
5,One of the best briyanis around Bhaktapur. The briyani tasted great with lots of flavors and aromas. Welcome staff and great hospitality. Will definately visit again.

1,"I would never recommend this place to any of my friends, the is overpriced for the quantity they provide. Pathetic taste."
1,"Biryani didn't even taste like biryani, there was no khada masala, it smelled like paan mostly and oh my god the price , 895 for medium size biryani. Some serious loot shit happening there"
4,Best place to hang out with good music and biryani
1,Too late 
1,"I ordered Morton kadai biryani through Pathao food and received chicken instead. When I inquired about it, they lied saying that they delivered the ordered item itself. So they not only have bad service but they are also a liar. Don't trust them"
2,I order Chicken biryani. Its just normal. and too expensive for that  much
5,"Ordered huge amount of biryani and all my family loved it. Thanks to the delivery boy for bringing on time and in far distance . Will ordered more again n will visit sooon ...

4,Good food with good mood friendly environment
5,Good hospitality yummy food
4,"I recently visited Biryani Adda at Radhe Radhe and had Paneer Matka Dum Biryani accompanied by Raita. The taste was top-notch, and I totally loved it. However, I can't understand why they don't serve water free of cost. Instead, they offer a litre of mineral water priced at Rs. 50. If you don't open the seal, you can ask them to deduct its price at the counter, which is a small consolation. Despite this, the service was good, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Plenty of parking space is available, which is a definite plus."
1,Overpriced menu. Better places around
1,"Why don't customer care to change the location name? Who is corresponding
I have spoken to Manish or Anish Yadav!
Crappy and waste of time. Just say no if you cannot do the task."
1,"pathao le deyako service use garna ni kati garo pathao discount deko xa bhanni tha vayepaxi driver haru poisa na thapi jannai na manni ajhai dhamki deni ki complain gardeenu bahnera

1,"Never using Pathao food again. I placed an order at 6 pm and waited for an hour, then the rider called me at 7 pm asking to cancel the order stating he's new a d he doesn't know how to place an order?? He could've called me sooner? Made ma wait an hour. And then when I called the customer care, they also said since the rider is new he didn't know how to handle the order and asked me to place a new order. It's one thing that the rider makes a mistake but as a representative Pathao should be responsible for the actions of their rider, if the customer has already waited an hour, instead of trying to satisfy the customer asking the customer to cancel the order and place a new order again for which the customer has to wait another extra hour??"
5,Nice
1,Pathao office la kaila panee phone cheepeat office
5,Mid baneshwor
3,"All services are good but WHY didn't you guys pick up any of the calls!! I had some issues while ordering food but when I tried to call pathao office, no response!"
5,I really appreciate the way Pathao reaponse to its customer
5,Good
1,Bad service!!!!
1,I ordered a ride but the riders are so far away from my location. I tried about four times but still I couldn't get a ride. I prefer in drive.
3,"I've already paid for my pathao student pack but can't activate the pack due to some issues, and customercare service aren't responding in this topic"
1,"Absolutely horrible experience with Pathao Food

This was my first time using Pathao Food and it turned out to be the worst experience ever. I ordered momo, and to my shock, the packaging was completely open and unhygienic. The aluminum foil had literally imprinted onto the momo, making it completely inedible.

I immediately contacted customer service and was asked to send photos, which I did right away. But after that? Silence. No response, no apology, no follow-up whatsoever. I called multiple times hoping to get an update, but not a single call was answered.

This level of carelessness and lack of basic customer support is beyond disappointing. If this is how Pathao handles food safety and customer concerns, I want nothing to do with this platform ever again.

Completely irresponsible service "
1,Worst experience ever
5,All good
1,So bad for food delivery rider ...asti vharkar aafnai  staff Lai lutnea raixau.insuraance KO name matrai raixa.kam chai rainaxaa
1,I did pathao food delivery. They took 2 thousand for the bag which is for the delivery and after when I resign and returned the bag they haven't refunded 2 thousand yet.
1,Pathao food is the most disgusting app ever with a very disgusting food service ever. And I'm so sorry to break it to you like this. This is happening to me for 2 months now that's why I'm very impatient. I tried ordering food from 3 different orders and still for an hour they wouldn't accept my order. And it happened repeatedly for 3 Fridays. After that they sent a promo code. What can I do with that promo code again if they wouldn't accept my food order. Where can I go and use that Code or whatever is it. I called the pathao food department and they wouldn't even accept my call so that I could address my problem.
5,Nice
5,Well organized
1,"You guys can't pick up an emergency call, are you all sleeping or what, I have been calling you guys for half an hour and no one's even picking it up.

It's been an hour and more I have sent a parcel from kritipur to balaju, but the rider is at budhanilkantha... And it's so urgent. "
3,Good service. friendly behaviour
1,Give more option of much more restro rather then limited tired of having it
4,"Rides:
Overall, the ride service is good, and it's great that you can use points to get discounts. However, sometimes the fare increases unexpectedly, which can be frustrating.

Food Delivery:
I would rate the food delivery service 5 out of 5. It's very convenient, and you can save money by using promo codes and Pathao Points, which is a big plus."
1,From today i m not using pathao and i don't recommend it.
1,"Pathao is just a ride sharing scammer. I complained twice to them via social media platforms regarding the matter but they never gave their statement. Neither did they reply.
The rider ' s location was just 3 min away from my location but they showed this much pickup fee. Since then i have avoided using it and not gonna use it again. Posted here so that others will also know about it.
Esp. Ringroad vanda thorei bahira ko location ma they have scammed me not only, once or twice but multiple times. The riders nowadays are very unprofessional. They just want to complete the ride with reckless driving. Last Time, I nearly caught a major accident near Kantipath. Luckily, the bus driver was sensible enough to brake. The riders are forcefully asking for extra money or tips. After multiple complaints also, they don't reply.So it is just a scammer."
5,Best ride sharing app in Nepal
1,"Pathao riders are becoming highly unreliable during urgent times like rain, night, early morning, and rush hours. Most of them reject rides and shift to Indrive to charge higher fares. Many even ask for double the price for offline rides, which is unfair and unsafe. This is very disappointing from a service that's supposed to be professional and convenient."
5,Quite efficient
5,This app is best app of nepal
1,"Hey sorry to say but I want to express my disappointment with the ride I took today at approximately 8 am
The driver Salin Rana increased fare double the actual amount at the drop point and it significantly impacted my experience .I rely on your service for safe ad pleasent ride ,and this experience did not meet those expections .
Totally dissapointed"
5,In drive 1year Experience
3,Why pathao is not in birendranagar surkhet
4,Good
1,Never going to order again there was a cockroach in my order
5,So good 
1,"Worst customer service, pathao is good only until there are no issues . Once the issue arrives they have no clue how to handle it nor solve it."
1,Too slow service...very bad experience
1,"0/10
Very bad customer service, never pick the calls, ridiculous"
1,"I traveled from my home to Bhrikuti Mandap with minimal traffic using Car Plus service. Initially, the fare was shown as NPR 286, but upon reaching the destination, I was charged NPR 416. This is a total scam! I strongly recommend using alternative services like InDrive instead."
1,Fraud app with worst customer service it let me stuck for 1 hour so dont use it anymore just un install it. It customer care is just for name like useless.
5,Always beter now
1,Costumer care services ma call uthauna kina garo. Irritating costumer service
1,My old mobile number has been lost so i can not change new number with old profile it is not really fair.
1,Pathao helpline/office KO phone received hudainaaa kinaaaa ho ??????
1,"I would give minus 10 if they have ratings.
Worst ever.

Diver should know about location rather than guest. Totally disgusting!

Informed driver that comes to the pin point, he said customer should give them actually where we are.

If customer knows about each and every location, they will not use this apps.

What about customer from outside valley???

This application seriously needs to be concern regarding this matter."
1,I ordered food below 400 to check if pathao delivers it or not and pathao didn't find any raiders to complete my order .
5,Good
4,A lovely and peaceful garden in the middle of Kathmandu. Perfect for a relaxed stroll or sitting by the fountains. Well-maintained and a nice escape from the city chaos. Entry fee is 200 NPR for Indians and higher for other foreigners.
5,This is a small oasis if peace in Kathmandu.

1,Too high ticket. Few Flowers no seats. Just waste of money . indian tourists
3,"Un giardino curatissimo e molto bello ma mi aspettavo qualcosa di piu grande.
Sicuramente un posto tranquillo ma per i miei gusti non vale la pena pagare 400 rupie per entrare, consiglio piuttosto altre esperienze da fare prima a Katmandu. Inoltre i prezzi del bar all'interno sono davvero cari."
4,"This is a very small Garden but it's a beautiful place,  very beautifully designed for sitting and chatting and making reels , beautiful unusual flower varieties are  there"
5,MEMORIES BRING BACK MEMORIES BRING BACK YOU
1,"I visited the Garden of Dreams with my friends for a college assignment, but unfortunately, our experience was very disappointing.

After purchasing our tickets and entering, we were excited to explore the garden and take some photos for our assignment. However, one of my friends was simply trying to change her shoes when the security guard rudely stopped her, saying we couldn't change ""anything"" inside--not even shoes. We even tried to convince that she'll change it outside and will return back but he rudely said ""No you can't come back again"". On top of that, we were also told we couldn't take photos, which didn't make sense since we saw other visitors freely taking pictures and videos.

The behavior of the security staff felt unnecessarily harsh and disrespectful. To make things worse, even the counter staff treated us poorly, giving side-eyes and acting rude for no reason. Because of this treatment, we were so upset that we decided to leave.

This experience completely ruined our impression of the Garden of Dreams. A place that is supposed to be welcoming and enjoyable instead felt uninviting and unpleasant. I would never recommend it to anyone, and I will definitely be sharing this negative experience with others."
1,"Worst place to spend your money. Wannabe greek style place. This place feels severely controlled and restricted. It is wrongly titled as ""tourist attraction"" when it's not."
4,This place is a small park/ garden in center of a city. Entry fees 400/-. Calm and quite place
3,Historical place
4,Best place to visit
5,"Wonderful place to visit, very beautiful..."
4,Had good experience but was kinda had to wait for a long time in line just to get inside
5,Best chiya shop in Kathmandu valley 
5,Quite a nice place to hangout with your Loved once .... peaceful environment and great decorations 
4,"The Garden of Dreams is truly a peaceful oasis in the middle of Kathmandu's hustle and bustle. The moment you step inside, the chaos of the city fades away and you are welcomed by calm pathways, beautiful fountains, and stunning architecture that carries a unique historical charm. The atmosphere is perfect for relaxing with friends, reading a book, or simply enjoying some quiet moments surrounded by nature. It is also a wonderful spot for photography, with its well-designed pavilions and scenic backdrops.
The cafe inside adds to the experience, offering a cozy place to sit down with a coffee or light meal while soaking in the serene environment. It feels like stepping back in time, with a touch of elegance and grace that makes you want to linger longer than planned.
The only thing that could make the experience even better would be more consistent maintenance of the garden areas. A few sections seem slightly neglected, and with just a bit more care, the place could shine even brighter.
Overall, it remains one of the best places in the city to escape the noise and enjoy tranquility--a true hidden gem worth visiting."
4,"It was cozy and nice, a little oasis in the city. Unfortunately it is very small and the entrance fee is relatively high for what it is."
4,A beautiful place to hangout

5,Worth the visit
5,It is undoubtedly an amazing garden in kathmandu.
2,"Rides and Slides were old, needs change."
5,Recommended
4,Liked it
3,"We really enjoyed the park. HOWEVER, the music was way too loud and full of awful words and sexualized content. I wanted to enjoy it with our children but as an English speaker I was shocked at how disgusting the music was for children. We would make many more trips back for family fun, but the music makes me not want to return. Perhaps the Nepali DJ does not know how bad the music is he's playing? Those songs would never be played at an American water park. Whoopee Land, please play family friendly music."
4,We payed Rs 750 for each. And was worth it. Though the fast food were slightly higher priced than average. Apart it was fun and good place for the kids and parents for short drive from the Kathmandu valley. Cheers
5,Nice slide

1,Ilogical expensive
4,Great place
4,Very good slides and fun many other games and amazing
1,"Visited whoopee land with my 6 year old boy but unfortunately the park didn't meet my expectations as the park was not well maintained, overcrowded and the water quality was very poor. On the other hand the park was dirty and rides were all broken, no safety at all.
This was the worst experience ever ."
5,Superb place to enjoy with your friends and family
3,"I visited Whoopee Land recently with high expectations, but unfortunately, the experience was far from enjoyable. The park was extremely crowded making it difficult to enjoy any of the rides or pools. Waiting times were long, and there was barely any space to relax or move around without bumping into people.

The biggest concern, however, was the **poor water quality**. Several pools looked murky and unclean, with an odd smell in some areas. It didn't feel hygienic or safe, especially for kids. Cleanliness should be a top priority in any water park, and sadly, Whoopee Land seems to fall short in this area.

Facilities like changing rooms and restrooms were also not well maintained. With the number of visitors, it felt like the staff were overwhelmed or not prepared to handle the crowd.

This place could have potential if they improved crowd management and significantly upgraded their hygiene standards. But as of now, I wouldn't recommend it unless major improvements are made."
5,Waterpark
3,Too much crowded on weekends.
5,"If you want hangout with friends with adventures then you must go..
One of best swimming pools in Kathmandu with different slides, dancing hall,etc."
4,It was nice but it was so busy in the pool area and the rides are old and it needed maintenance.
5,"All the games super fun, really thrilling slides and lovely whole day to spend with family, highly recommend  top notch experience waiting....rejuvenating for refreshments"
3,just visit in lean day (recommended)
5,I am not go but I like it
5,Best waterpark in valley

5,Nice
5,Good
4,Once
4,Nice place to visit in summer
3,Good and worthy
2,"Visited Whoopee Land recently after several years, and honestly, it was quite underwhelming. No new rides or slides have been added in the past 5-6 years, which makes the park feel outdated and repetitive.

The Jurassic Park section is in terrible condition -- most of the dinosaur props are damaged or broken, and it's clear that there has been no proper maintenance for a long time.

The food prices inside are extremely high, and the quality doesn't match the cost. On top of that, the park often gets very crowded with school trips, which makes the queues for rides and slides unbearably long.

With the high ticket price, you'd expect better upkeep and at least some new attractions. Unfortunately, it seems like the park hasn't evolved at all. Definitely not worth visiting if you've already been in the past."
5,Perfect for big events and receptions
3,They have to really work on services while doing big parties
5,"We have our wedding reception on July 12, 2025. Everything went smoothly at Alice Receptions, and we were delighted with the food, ambience, parking space, and overall management. Our guests particularly enjoyed the variety of snack offerings."
4,"Good place for wedding, seminars, and other gatherings of 500 people.

Located at the Centre of the city makes easy transportation.

Huge parking space."

4,Nice
5,Great for party n event
5,"We recently celebrated our post-wedding reception at Alice Reception, and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful experience. From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed with warmth, professionalism, and care that truly went beyond our expectations.

The venue itself was exceptionally comfortable and aesthetically pleasing--every corner felt thoughtfully designed to create a cozy yet elegant atmosphere for us and our guests. The entire team at Alice was incredibly courteous and attentive, making sure everything ran smoothly and that we felt relaxed throughout the celebration.

What truly touched our hearts was their thoughtful gesture. They surprised us with a personalized gift--a beautifully printed photo of us as a couple on a plate--and a generous gift voucher. It was an emotional and unexpected moment that made us feel truly seen and celebrated, not just as clients, but as a couple beginning a new chapter.

We're deeply grateful to Alice Reception for making our special day even more memorable. Their exceptional service, beautiful space, and heartfelt hospitality made it a perfect venue for our celebration. Highly, highly recommend for anyone planning a wedding, reception, or any special event.

With love and gratitude,
Sushma & Nimish"
4,Ambiance 
5,"We recently attended a wedding reception for my brother-in-law at this venue, and the experience was outstanding. The food was of excellent quality, the facility was exceptionally clean, and the event was well-organized from start to finish. The staff demonstrated a high level of professionalism and were extremely helpful and attentive throughout the evening. I would highly recommend this reception hall for any special event.
10 out of 101"
3,Perfect place for wedding party. Plenty of parking space. Foods are also satisfactory. Nice ambiance. I would like to recommend it.

1,"The snacks service was very  very slow. The main food for dinner very bad. Time to change the chef and also your so called pad thai in dinner portion , does your chef know what pad thai is???  Food at your restaurant is way betted than at the reception....
Time has changed ... need to improve your service and food quality!!!!"
5,Good 
5,All time favorite for family and corporate
4,"it's good place  for wedding party, you don't need  to worry about 4 wheeler parking."
5,"Awesome experience, one of the finest banquet areas. The selection of food items were just awesome. Loved the hot jalebis."
5,Great place for parties and wedding receptions. It's very spacious and has plenty of parking too. The food and drinks are also great.
1,Simply nice 
3,Decorations are dope. But KANJOOS party venue. The refill of snaks  are bit slow. The momo person was rude. He said the momo was finished at 7 pm. At that time the party just started.
5,Popular party palace these days !! Food is better.
5,Alice reception is a good place to party. They offer a wide range of services for events.
5,Very beautiful ambiance also good service
4,It is as good a place you can get to organize a event dinner.. ample parking.. good atmosphere and food is not bad
1,I don't like manager behaviour
5,Good place for events
1,Worst food ever..i was so much disappointed by the food. So stale food and stinky. How could you serve such food to reception. Please maintain your brand. And most irritating was the manager...so much attitude....hope you retain your business in future. I will never recommend other for their reception on Alice.
5,It's good for party. Food is good
5,Good hospitality and delicious food served
5,Best price
3,Liked the way its built and AMBIENCE BUT they really should focus on serving the snacks properly as the snacks were not served at all n had to wait hours for even one kind of snack to be served
4,"Good food, good location, huge parking space but deducting 1 star because the banquet itself is very small."
5,Great place to host your family and friends.
5,"I took my mom and aunt for dinner. The food served was too good. The fusion of newari cuisine was very delightful to watch and taste. My mom and aunt were very satisfied. Overall, the experience was very good."
3,Not worth the hype...
5,"We didn't use the accommodation but ate at the restaurant. It was very nice. Service was great, good AC, food was great! I would love to visit again. It was a little difficult to find the entrance at first but very close to the square."
1,"Went here for lunch with some mates and was extremely disappointed with the food.
Wrong items came and the food was tasteless.
Would definitely NOT reccomend"
1,"Its a nice place but doesn't meet expectations .
Lack of profession .
Old and narrow  conception ."
5,"Staying at The Nanee feels like stepping back in time. The moment you step out, you are transported into centuries of rich history and heritage. The staff are extremely courteous, the rooms are comfortable, and the food is excellent. A perfect blend of old-world charm and modern comfort. Highly recommended."
5,"Bhaktapur has centuries of art and genius and the Nanee reflects all the deep magic of Nepal, what a beautiful building filled with incredible art. What a wonderful restaurant and bar with the finest of foods. Location is ideal, the staff are pure heart. This is Nepal alive and thriving on the top of the world!"
5,Everything was amazing. From the arrival to the departure. Thanks a lot again
5,"We recommend this wonderful restaurant as it is a very peaceful and lovely place. It will serve you not just high quality food yet so much more. The atmosphere is unique and The waitstaff Akash, Manjila, Mr jack are all wonderfully sweet and personable. They will love to serve you and  give you an amazing experience. We recommend the pumpkin soup which is rich and fully balanced, which comes with fresh homemade bread.  We also really enjoyed Nanee style noodle soup that comes with wonderful mushrooms on top.  The chef and the kitchen staff are providing beautifully curated meals that are clean and delicious. We highly recommend you come & enjoy  for yourselves.
Tell them you heard about it from Rockstar and Echo"
5,"It is premium property in Bhaktapur durbar square. The food quality, presentation and service matches the fine dining experience. It was a surprise to see such a professional hospitality services in Bhaktapur."
5,"What an amazing find - a friend recommended this hotel as a great base to explore Bhaktapur and we weren't disappointed! This small boutique hotel is tucked away in a courtyard very close to Bhaktapur Durbar Square (no more than 5 mins away) and we had a wonderful 2-night stay. The staff are outstanding and always responsive to any questions that you have.

While you can just spend your time enjoying the unique architecture of the hotel based on Vaastu Shastra principles (similar to Feng shui), I recommend that you consider any of the cultural experiences that the hotel provides. We thoroughly enjoyed the walking tour and the 6-course  contemporary Newari menu. All the other food in the restaurant is also delicious.

The rooms are arranged around the courtyard and quite compact given the overall footprint of the hotel. Our group stayed in a standard, Prithvi and a Nepali suite and I would say that the Prithvi room was the best overall in terms of space and amenities.

Thank you to Aditya-ji and the rest of his team for a memorable stay!"
5,Cozy place in the middle of the city. Our host advised us to just lose our way and immerse ourselves in experiencing the narrow alleys of the old town. We simply loved our stay. They were kind enough to arrange for us some vegetarian options for breakfast and you will definitely enjoy some of the cute little surprises they've in store for you. Also the artwork and detailing at property is incredibly beautifully done and they've done a great job at connecting themselves with the community that the property is part of.
5,"Had an amazing stay at The Nanee (06APR - 08APR)!  Excellent customer service the moment I checked into my Loft Room.  Very well designed property and room.  Enjoyed the lookout view from my private balcony.  Well layout bathroom.  Enjoyed the Morning Walk, Evening Walking Tour, local artisan home visit and great introduction to the Newari traditional breakfast.  Thank you so much to Ajay and Shailaja (the gracious owners), Aditya (the General Manager), Roshna (Receptionist), Kumar (F & B staff member) and the rest of the wonderful team at The Nanee! Your passion, dedication and commitment shows.  You showed me your lovely city making it so memorable for many years to come!"
4,"Just went for lunch there, good food, good service"
5,"Beautiful design, clean hotel, well decorated and the food was so good. I recommend it !"
5,"Enjoyed the lunch with family. They have creative food items blending the Newari culture.
Yummy."
5,"L equipe est vraiment geniale, professionnelle et gentille avec une spontaneite. La cuisine est d'un niveau international. Le decor est soigne. Nous y reviendrons. Mention speciale pour le cocktail maison."
5,"Outstanding hotel, extremely friendly staff, very clean, beautiful rooms, great design, the food was also great. It was the only hotel on our 2 weeks long trip through nepal that had proper bread for breakfast. We also had dinner in the hotel restaurant and we can safely say it was the best dinner we had in whole nepal. Very clean kitchen as well - you can watch the chefs through a large window. Location couldn't be better, roof top terrace was also nice

If there is one thing I would change it's just that I would have loved to have some vegan milk alternatives for the coffee in the morning eg oat milk - but as you can see from this suggestion, literally everything else was a 5/5."
5,"A unique design, friendly service in the heart of Bhaktapur. Beds are very comfortable. Many experiences available during the stay.
I recommend to spend 3 nights to grab the essence of the Newari culture."
5,"It was perfect.beautiful, modern room with everything you need. Lovely bed nice shower looks exactly like the pictures . Staff supervisor nice helpful. Nice restaurant with delicious food"
5,"My stay at The Nanee hotel was amazing! I stayed in the Nepali room and it was very luxurious as well as comfortable. The food at The Nanee restaurant was delicious and very professionally prepared. Loved the beautiful architecture and atmosphere, will definitely come back again!"
5,Beautiful modern rooms but with a Newari touch and great service. Staff are kind and helpful.
5,Beautiful property.. staying there is an experience itself
5,"Sehr guter Service, tolles, modernes Hotel in bester Lage und leckerem Fruhstuck"
5,"Fantastic boutique hotel with excellent amenities, helpful staff, and delicious food. We had many moments of delight throughout the entire experience, from the warm welcome ceremony to the personalized hand-written card, as well as the thoughtfully provided in-room snacks and games. Everything felt authentic and carefully crafted to enhance our stay."
5,"We flew to Nepal for the first time.
When we were driving from Kathmandu airport, we looked at the city around and did not expect to get such an incredible hotel! 
The hotel is hidden among buildings on a narrow street, which is not accessible by car. And this is a pleasant surprise
You walk into a fairy tale. The interior has a chic design, everything is in a modern style, very organic and clean.
The staff is very polite and friendly, taking care of the guests. 
We didn't meet any other tourists inside except the two of us.
The hotel restaurant is very good, tasty and warm. Lots of food and drink menu options. "
5,"When you enter the hotel from the street it's like a small paradise. Quiet, clean, very warm welcome. The rooms are wonderful, the food excellent."
4,Good place
5,Excellent stay
5,"We had a wonderful moment at The Nanee. Great rooms, amazing people and good food. After a long travel from France, we had the chance to spend a relaxing time here. Thank you all for your kindness!"

5,Beautiful
5,"Great location, right next to Bhaktapur Durbar square. The rooms are very cozy and modern style.  The beds are very comfortable, and the wifi is very fast.

The hotel looks like a museum, full of local handicrafts and pices of local art.

The staff is very helpful,  we loved our stay here. The best of all is the food, I think we haven't had better food anywhere else during our 1 month stay in Nepal"

So it's up to you whether to choose such manpower agency, paying excessive amount of money for small amount of salary and excess working hours.

I did use River Overseas for more than once, YES it was good back then however, it isn't even up to the level that this manpower can be recommended for someone going gulf region on work visas."

You might be shocked about my results, but u don't deserve it
You deserve to be rated 100 + star rating.
even there lots of money diggers agencies but there still no agency tht can overtake or replace this ....

The tv actually works, which is so rare in Nepal! Breakfast is adequate. Staff is friendly and professional. The rooms that overlook the garden are quieter."
5,Good
5,"A very good hotel at a very good price 
The rooms are a good size, the bed was very comfortable and the hotel is very clean.
We arrived early and they were very accommodating to us.
You can store luggage securely when you're away trekking.
In such a busy area, you don't hear the outside noise, which is a bonus."
5,"Un havre de paix dans le quartier de Thamel, un jardin plein de recoins plus charmants les uns que les autres. Ne pas rater l'arriere du jardin qui offre des transats a l'abri des regards, sauf celui de Bouddha protecteur.

5,Very good service and friendly environment. A beautiful place and kind people
5,"Semplice hotel nel cuore di Thamel, ma con un giardino interno che permette di stare fuori, protetti dallo smog di Katmandu."
4,"International Guest House is a well priced hotel centrally located in the main tourist district, but on a quieter street. It has a lovely garden courtyard where you can relax and enjoy the nice breakfast buffet that is included with your stay; when we stayed, the citrus trees blooming gave off an incredible scent! The staff are very friendly and attentive. We stayed in three different rooms during our stops in Kathmandu: the ""deluxe"" rooms are worth the extra 10-15 usd a night as they have air conditioning and are a bit bigger. Like many place in Nepal, hot water is provided by solar heaters, so you may not get a hot shower first thing in the morning. Wait until the afternoon to guarantee hot water!

All and all, we would gladly stay here again!"
5,"Das International Guest House in Kathmandu ist ein echtes Juwel im Herzen von Thamel. Das historische Gebaude strahlt einen ganz besonderen Charme aus und bietet eine wunderbare Mischung aus traditioneller Architektur und freundlichen Servie. Besonders beeindruckend ist der grune Innengarten, der eine ruhige Oase der Erholung mitten im lebhaften Trubel von Thamel bildet - ein perfekter Ort, um nach einem Tag voller Erkundungen zur Ruhe zu kommen. Die angeschlossene Backerei ist ein weiteres Highlight: Frische, kostliche Backwaren und leckere Kaffeespezialitaten laden zum Verweilen ein. Die Atmosphare ist warm und einladend, das Personal freundlich und aufmerksam. Ein absolut empfehlenswerter Aufenthalt fur alle, die Authentizitat und Komfort in perfekter Harmonie suchen."

2,The grounds are very nice but that's where it ends. The rooms are overpriced and the beds are very uncomfortable - you'll feel springs in your back. They have a Cafe attached that is a chain smokers delight. The smoke fills all the areas - the last thing one needs after breathing yak pancake smoke in the Himalayas
3,Beautiful typically traditional guesthouse in Thamel with beautiful garden to enjoy !
5,"Emplacement central en plein milieu du quartier de Thamel avec de nombreux magasins et restaurants a proximite.
L'hotel possede un jardin et une cours interieure avec des tables ou vous pourrez passer un moment au calme, a l'abri de l'agitation de la rue.
Les chambres ne sont pas tres grandes mais c'est suffisant. Elles sont dotees d'un bureau. La salle de bain est simple, avec de l'eau chaude ! Ce qui vous fera le plus grand bien si vous revenez d'un trek.
Le petit dejeuner en buffet est assez varie, vous devriez trouver votre bonheur.
Vous pouvez demander a la reception de conserver vos bagages ou de vous commander un taxi, ils sont serviables."
4,"Very friendly and helpful receptionists.
Central location in Thamel. Easy access.

The breakfast menu is every day, the same."
1,The waitress of the restaurant was very rude and treated us poorly was disappointed with the service and the treatment of the staff
5,Restaurant authentique dans le centre de thamel et le confort
5,Very fun cool looking very cool
5,"Unserer Meinung nach das beste Hotel der Stadt, superfreundliches und hilfsbereites Personal, die Zimmer sehr ordentlich, sauber, geraumig und mit dem wichtigen Dingen, wie Steckdosen, WC-Papier, Sitz-Toilette, warmer Dusche, Spiegel, Handtucher, Seife usw. ausgestattet sind. Die Lage in Thamel ist ausgezeichnet und es ist verhaltnismassig ruhig. Erst recht, wenn man ein Zimmer auf den super gepflegten Garten im Innenbereich erwischt. Wir sind praktisch zum 4.Mal hier und jedesmal bestens aufgehoben. Danke an das Team von Jens+Mary."
4,"nice place at the edge of Thamel, quiet with spacious amenities like gardens and patios, as a shop in shop is a little family run cafe with good coffee and homemade cakes and pastries, very close to plenty of outdoor shops and upper level cafes, would stay there again"
5,"Great location, friendly staff and clean rooms and toilets. The palce is VERY QUIET and it's right in the center of Thamel. Prices are fine. Breakfast (included) is small but good."
3,"An okay hotel located just on the side of Thamel, a good location for quite area of Kathmandu, however the facilities lack, for the price you pay it is okay, but what was advertised on the website was incorrect when we were at the room, the room was okay had all the basics part from shower products, no AC, just a fan, beds were uncomfortable."
4,Rooms were good. Atmosphere and place was good. If you love art and old style that is the place to stay
5,"What a great ambiance! It's tucked away from the hustle of Thamel, with bhodi trees, and Buddha statue motifs carved into mahogany wood walls. It feels like you're entering a warm, dark Newari temple. Very Indiana Jones, almost romantic. The dining area opens to a stone courtyard with ""artifact""-like vases and stone bhudda statues collecting dust on wooden shelves, connecting to an open cafe with terra-cotta tiled floors. A light jazz is playing there and you can relax w a book, while the monsoon rains drip off the tiled roofs.

Rooms are clean, firm beds, good water pressure and temp, flush toilet w TP. Doors/locks are sturdy. I've only had chicken curry for dinner, but it was excellent and I thought it was well-priced. Breakfast is included and is buffet style w yogurt, fruits, cereals, boiled eggs or omelette, toast, tea and instant coffee.

Front desk staff are service oriented and namaste me every time I walk by. Fast wifi, but the power goes out occasionally (street level problem), and  it takes a minute for wifi to come back up. The only other slight downside is you have to cross a fairly busy street w mopeds and taxis to get into Thamel proper. But you'll be dodging mopeds everywhere in Thamel.

I would 100% stay here again if I came back to Kathmandu."
5,Great location . Very nice environment 
5,"Having enjoyed many stays here over the years the IGH remains my go-to place to stay in Thamel. Recently updated (was overdue) the hotel retains its crown as a peaceful oasis of calm and aesthetic beauty within north Thamel. The gardens and seating areas are most excellent and feature a vast museum collection of Nepali cultural items and, in particular, architectural pieces including many that have been incorporated into the hotel itself. Rooms on five floors provide en suite facilities and are maintained to a high standard on a daily basis. Included buffet style breakfast.. with cooked options available, has been recently updated and extended to provide a high quality western style selection.
The long established staff and facilities reflect a high standard of care for their guests. Prices are mid-range and cater for the more discriminating guests including NGO workers that value the peaceful, maybe less tourist centred, atmosphere.
All credit to the owner and staff for maintaining this excellent establishment."
5,Le jardin est tres agreable.
1,"Bel edifice mais chambres vetustes.
Manque d'entretien et c'est dommage."
5,10th visit. Chill place in Thamel.
4,Good clean and very friendly hotel
5,Rustige plek in het drukke Kathmandu. Goede locatie voor toeristen.
4,"Pretty amazing experience we had, their in-house cafe is a bonus, one drawback is Internate Coverage which can be improvised, apart from that they are always accomodative, flexible, friendly "
5,A place of relaxation and quiet in the middle of busy Thamel. I liked it a lot!
3,"Nothing so special, it's good if you wanna use this place only to sleep. Area is enough quite and close to everything. Breakfast is ok. However,  for that price I think you can get something better in Katmandu"
4,"The hotel is worthy for its quite central position and the really beautiful and characteristics common area. The rooms, on the other side, are a bit old and the bathroom really needs a renovation. We didn't take the basic room and the space was still barely ok, so my guess is that basic rooms would be really small for a couple. Breakfast was not having big selection but fruit was fresh and omlete quite good so no complains there for the price point. The personel was kind and helpful so this is another plus. So I feel to suggest it for the position and the really amazing common areas (and also the price that was quite a bargain) but if instead you are searching for recently refreshed rooms with amenities, I suggest you to look elsewhere. If you have a bit of adaptation it can be an amazing experience."
5,"We spent 3 nights here and loved so much the environment. From the crowded street you step into a peaceful place with a smiling staff. Clean rooms, hot shower (which is precious ), good food. Perfect! "
1,"Rudest Owners and Hotel staff I have ever encountered. I went there to check out the hotel after looking at the good reviews on TripAdvisor. Interacted with the front desk who was very decent and then went on to scout the garden and architecture. I happen to wander into an empty hotel building. Soon after, without any warning, I was greeted with hostility for ""walking without permission"" and looked at with suspicion. Guards and hotel staff surrounded me and were very rude. I thought talking to the manager/owner would help me sort this out calmly. Neither did he try to assess the situation fairly, nor did he even listen. I wonder if they would have the same reaction to a foreigner or was it me being Nepali that warranted this disrespect? Disheartened by the blatant racism inside my own country, by my own people, at such a decent establishment."
5,"My clients who came for a trek in nepal stayed here for a weeks and they loved the Service , Rooms and Ambience  ."
4,Amazing space in such crowded area with really amazing newari style architecture and elements. They do have collection of bonsai in there garden. The carrot cake is really good in this place.
5,All the best 
5,"Peaceful hotel in thamel
With good quality attached toilet bathroom
The guards are also helpful and you can get mostly everything nearby the hotel"
5,"My favorite hotel in Katmandu, away from the mad city traffic. Peaceful place with a lovely garden & beautiful wooden architecture. Room are comfy and breakfast is nice. Good food too, if you want to eat your dinner there. And the staff are really friendly and helpful."

5,"They are very fast, and I received my package safe and sound. It was a fragile item, particularly my laptop, but I noticed they carried my laptop personally while other items were in the cart. Highly recommended! They were open until 8 PM, which is a plus since Buddha Airlines flights serve until 9 PM. Another great is that I was late, so I chose to leave the package at the counter. None of the other airlines' cargo services agreed keep my package there and dispatch it the next morning, but Buddha Airlines staff were so generous that they agreed to keep my package safely and deliver it the next morning."

5,"Rising majestically from a bustling circular road in Kathmandu, the Boudhanath Stupa is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most significant center of Tibetan Buddhism outside of Tibet. Its colossal white dome, one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal, is a powerful symbol of the Buddhist cosmos, a vast mandala that draws pilgrims and tourists into its orbit. The stupa is believed to have been built in the 5th century and has served for centuries as a vital hub for trade and cultural exchange between Nepal and Tibet.
The architecture of the stupa is deeply symbolic. The immense white dome represents the element of water, while the square harmika above it, adorned with the iconic pair of Buddha's all-seeing eyes, symbolizes earth. A nose-like figure between the eyes is the Nepali number one, signifying unity, and above that, 13 golden steps represent the 13 stages a soul must pass through to achieve enlightenment. The pinnacle, a golden spire, represents the element of fire and the ultimate state of Buddhahood. Colorful prayer flags, fluttering from the top of the stupa, carry mantras and prayers on the wind, spreading positive energy and blessings throughout the valley.
The atmosphere at Boudhanath is one of active devotion. From early morning until late evening, a constant stream of devotees, many of them Tibetan refugees who have made this area their home, circumambulate the stupa clockwise, spinning the prayer wheels and reciting mantras. The air is filled with the scent of juniper incense and the soft hum of chants. The area around the stupa has evolved into a vibrant cultural hub, with countless monasteries, guesthouses, cafes, and shops selling Tibetan handicrafts, thangka paintings, and ritual objects. A visit to Boudhanath is not merely a spiritual pilgrimage but a total immersion into the sights, sounds, and traditions of a living and thriving Buddhist culture."
5,Luogo mistico e ascetico per chi intende leggere nel giusto verso la religione
5,Nice  vibes
5,"Namaste I'm a local from ktm I've visited this place like literally hundreds of times.
The Bouddha stupa is a wonder my country Nepal has to provide .An omniscient and magnificent piece of aetiological history representing the buddhist community and the diverse history of Nepal.

A physical monument proudly standing tall as the living proof of Nepali cultural diversity.As not a person who doesn't follow the Buddhist religion I everytime wanna go here and stroll around when I get the time or when I'm feeling a little low.

The magnifying chaityas and the famous stupa itself kinda give you reality check on your life though the pricing for snack or other momentos may be a little high for the normal Nepalj public but it helps keep the tourism business flourishing.

Greatful to have the chance to leisurely roam such a magnificent, omniscient and divine location.

I highly recommend any kind of people from every age gap to visit this place .A must go place to cleanse your mental and emotional palate.

Worth every second u stay there .
Hope my review was a little help to the people planning to have a visit here.

The last thing, don't forget to buy your souvenir, click beautiful picture with your loved ones and your peers and come back to leave a review of your experience.Thankyou."
5,"Best and chill place to visit
What a beautyy of Nepal "
5,"""Boudhanath Stupa Kathmandu ka sabse peaceful aur divine place hai. Huge stupa ke 360deg par walk karte wagt ek alag hi spiritual energy feel hoti hai. Monks ki chanting aur prayer flags ki vibe pura atmosphere ko positive bana dete hai. Yahan ki local cafes se stupa ka view enjoy karna bhi ekdum memorable experience hai. Jo log Kathmandu aate hain unke liye yeh place must-visit hai for peace & spirituality."""
5,"""Visiting the Boudha Stupa in Kathmandu was a deeply calming experience. The sheer size of the white dome with the golden spire and the watchful eyes of the Buddha instantly creates a sense of peace. Walking around the kora (circumambulation path) with monks, locals, and pilgrims made me feel connected to something timeless.

The stupa is surrounded by vibrant prayer flags, traditional Tibetan chants, and small monasteries and cafes, making the atmosphere both spiritual and lively. It's not just a religious site, but also a cultural hub where you can feel the strong Tibetan Buddhist influence.

Even if you're not religious, the serenity of the place makes it worth visiting. I'd highly recommend going during early morning or evening, when butter lamps are lit and the stupa glows beautifully. Definitely one of the must-visit landmarks of Nepal."""
5,It is nice
4,Different feeling in this place. Many tourists here makes this an exciting place.
5,Spritual place
5,"The climb up the 365 steps is a journey in itself! Be prepared for plenty of mischievous monkeys (hold onto your glasses and snacks!), but the effort is worth it.

Reaching the top reveals not just the majestic stupa, but one of the best views of the entire Kathmandu Valley."
5,Good
5,peace place
5,"Boudha Stupa is one of the most significant cultural and spiritual landmarks in Nepal. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it stands as a symbol of peace, harmony, and Buddhist faith. The massive white dome and gilded spire, adorned with the iconic eyes of Buddha, create an awe-inspiring sight that reflects centuries of tradition and devotion.

The atmosphere around the stupa is serene yet vibrant, with devotees performing kora (circumambulation), spinning prayer wheels, and offering butter lamps. Monasteries surrounding the stupa enhance its spiritual ambiance, while the presence of local shops and traditional eateries add cultural richness to the experience.

A visit to Boudha Stupa provides not only architectural and historical insight but also a deep sense of tranquility. It is truly a destination of both spiritual significance and cultural heritage, making it an essential highlight for visitors to Kathmandu."
