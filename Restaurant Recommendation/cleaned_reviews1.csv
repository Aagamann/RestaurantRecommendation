our experience of this place was excellent the staff was really nice and really good good the service was excellent healthy and fresh food and vibe this is the best place for you thank you fusion team see you again
really nice food best place yo eat
chicken butter masala was excellent friendly people

the experience was really good nepali khana set and veg thukpa soup amazing the ambience is peaceful and friendly food is also great the staffs are also really friendly and helpful
great place in kathmandu serves a good nepali khana set awesome all day breakfast fusion breakfast set try the other food too nepali momos is to die for and the staff is maybe the best part so warm welcoming they helped me out with a lot of things and didnt want anything in return
tres bon restaurant a thamel accueil chaleureux ne passez pas a cote des excellents momos
very good resturant and they have option of alcohol right on the street during rush hour you may have to wait for serve so ensure your plan as per that food very tasty no doubt
lao ban re qingshi wu mei weishi you dian rong he ni bo er dang di can yin yu zhong shi mei shi de zu hedi dian zai thamelre nao de di fangfei chang zhi de yi lai zai lai
the place has amazing vibe the food is extremely delicious and served with great precision to taste the place feels so homelike that one comes back again and again had a great connect with the owner who not only helped extensively with daily tour booking but also shared his expert guidance on places to visit and shop highly recommended
well let us cut this review short over all it is acceptable yet is not as expected near to most of the main hotels there affordable npr and within average ordered dhal thali two mo mo s one pumpkin soup dhal with roti humble host and kind you can ask for his help preparation of food will take more than expected for a fast food the restaurant is located on a very noisy road non stop honking and cars passing by food taste was not as expected service could be in the slack side when it is needed at times overall it will get three starts rating just be mindful when reading reviews around the country it could be misleading sometimes
belle decouverte pour le dejeuner dans ce restaurant super accueil et bons plats je recommande
nice
nice stuff good food
excelente comida muy rico el te y el desayuno ademas de que es bastante barato pero lo mejor es sin duda el dueno muy amable y servicial

we were very disappointed the service of multiple waiters was not friendly at all and it was very dark when we tried to turn the light on they asked us why we want light based on the good reviews here we were expecting a lot more wont go there again
perfect atmosphere and great food served by amazing people
really appreciative service from the restaurant owner raju actually we had a birthday celebration of one of my friends in the fusion himalaya restaurant the food was literary the best in thamel mouth sizzling chicken c momo chicken chilli chicken sizzlar and desserts our tummy was asking for more we really had an amazing food set in the restaurant and recommend to try it once the best part is when raju asks you how was the food and suggest customers if they are happy or unhappy so fusion himalaya restaurant is best
we found this restaurant when last in kathmandu a few weeks ago we ate here every single lunch and dinner great food and friendly service
best dal bhat of city
super nice owner who seems to really care if his customers enjoy their visit c momos are delicious the nicest we had in nepal
se come muy bien el local es agradable como el personal precio populares se recomienda
i had quite a lot of momos in kathmandu but none of them were as nice as the special c momos here i had the vegetable ones and came back for a second time and i will be back for the third and maybe fourth time the taste is incredible and if you like your food spicy like i do you can get some great spicy really spicy sauce the personal is really friendly and not too much like in other places highly recommended if you are looking for the best momos in town
good service and the momo c is highly recommended i had thenthuk and my partner had chicken dal and plain lassi the thenthuk is quite the fix just when the days temperature is starting to drop
best dinner in city
great place for food can get a little noisy and sometimes you have to wait for like mins to get a seat in my case i had to wait for around mins thats why stars other than that the place is good
they sell local food like dal bhat thukpa and thenthunk here prices are reasonable place is clean food took awhile to be prepared though
que ricos los momos fritos y el chowmei
the food here was sooo tasty the best food we had during our stay in nepal we ate mustang alu veg c momos and vegtable cutlet and it all was reaaaally delicious also the place itself was cozy and the staff were very friendly definitely a recommendation for your stay in ktm if we ever come back to ktm well be back at fusion himalaya restaurant
very small fairly clean terribly cheap rupees for a veg chowmein quick service
after weeks trying i found the best sukuti the thentuk is also really good
poco conocido sitio en kathmandu todavia pero sin duda el mejor restaurante de comida nepalitibetana de toda la ciudad es dificil de encontrar si no has ido nunca pero no puedes irte de kathmandu sin visitarlo atencion estupenda increible amabilidad y eficiencia de los camareros la comida esta increible deliciosa muchisima variedad para todos los gustos desde poco a muy picante comida de nepal tailandesa tibetana perfecto para probar un poco de todo el precio es de risa te dan ganas de pagar mas nosotros estuvimos y comimos platos postre y bebidas y no llego a diez euros al cambiounas rupias nepalis aproximadamente dejas obviamente bastante propina por la calidad y lo bajo del precio limpio bonito bien decorado comida buenisima nos gusto tanto que fuimos dos veces cerca esta la calle z buena para comprar souvenirs a buen precio de los mejores restaurantes de thamel para disfrutar la comida tipica

one of the best price per value in ktm for what ive seen
a wonderful and very recommend place run by raju a smiling and very helpful man great food best cmomos in town always one of the first addresses i go to to when i m on my regular kathmandu trips i definitely recommend the veg cmomos the alu sandeko and the dal bhat
highly recommended i have been here a few times and would not hesitate to return anytime the food was really delicious tried some local dishes all of them were excellent the coffee was wonderful the staff was very welcoming and kind the atmosphere of the place is great had the pleasure of meeting mr raju the owner who was extremely helpful and friendly i have seen local people eating here as well that is always a good hint i guess
delicious fresh food the alu mustang and the alu sandeko are wonderful as is the vegetable fried rice its right on paknajol marg so its easy to find the staff is helpful and friendly also the artwork on the walls is great and the place itself is clean and cozy
cozy and comfortable relatively small menu with good food at reasonable price

tried many and this is one of my highlights in kathmandu service is super friendly food is delicius you cant leave nepal without trying dal baht nor thukpa there prices are fair compared to other cozy tourist traps they offer also continental food but come on you traveled thousand of milestry this tasty food we also ordered our food requesting not being spicy and they managed to do so so recommended for us
hier gibts die besten mu mu super aussicht auf den grossten stupa die vielen einkaufsladen bieten gute qulitat zu fahren preisen an
cheap food and attentive staff food was a little bit bkand but still good thukpa noodle soup is great
fusion himalya is simply the best vfm restaurant in kathmandu the food is really good and freshly made and the service is friendly and curteous also food prep and hygiene levels are up to western standards which unfortunately is not always the case in many small eateries in kathmandu the owner and staff speak english and have created an environment with a relaxed vibe that is very popular with backpackers trekkers and tourists a must try if youre visiting or passing through kathmandu highly recommended
great food with good price and very nice staff

fantastyczne miejsce super jedzenie koniecznie trzeba przyjsc i delektowac sie jedzeniem
great for lunch
great food relax vibe and very friendly and passionate staff family business worth trying and encourage
i had my first meal in nepal at this restaurant my friends and i ordered a nepali set and a fusion himalaya soup to share we also tried momo the waiter didnt really speak english and they didnt repeat our order so our orders came twice we protested but they didnt seem to be happy about it overall the food was good though
good foods ok prices a little higher prices but has good quality foods and place to dine
good quality tasty foods stylish environment comfortable enjoyable location is just outside of main tourist streets easy to get to with gps map i had momo c with buffalo meat stuffed in each dumpling deep fried crispy shell covered by a rich flavor tasting thick tomato sauce kind of like italian pasta sauce npr costs a little more than other places but this is very good quality with a lot of tomato sauce worth a try especially if you like the texture an taste of meat balls in pasta sauce their fusion himalaya special soup is also good tastes freshly made with some cooked beans you can chew on npr though pricey for a small bowl of soup but worth it if you like good healthy soup in cold weather
pas la peine de chercher plus loin that is our canteen strongly recommend you have your lunch or diner here des repas traditionnels nepalais en plus ils sont super sympa
omg super yummy
best dal bhat ever great service
cheap and friendly
ok nepali fare nothing too write home about

we had an excellent experience at thamel doner kebab my friend uncle and i ordered their shawarma wrapped in buckwheat bread and it was absolutely delicious the portion size was generousjust two shawarmas were more than enough for the three of us to share the unique flavor of the buckwheat bread paired perfectly with the flavorful shawarma filling the staff was friendly and welcoming and the overall ambiance was great highly recommended for anyone looking for a satisfying and unique dining experience in thamel
food is freshly cooked and delicious little bit more sauce in the wrap would be great staffs are friendly
they provide a refreshing alternative to traditional nepalinewari food in kathmandu we had the chicken doner kebabs shawarma and fries the kebabs were great and the fries must be one of the best in town i hope they can keep up the taste and portion sizes

never expected to find such authentic and fresh doner kebab in nepal but was pleasantly surprised by this place they informed that there would be a wait for the chicken which was well worth it after many late night and drunken kebab feeds i can definitely say that this has to be one of the best ive ever had and excellent value for money as well

i tried the doner platter the portion was great and the taste was also great little bit insatiable to my nepali spices craving tongue maybe thats why initially i loved the taste but couldnt eat the whole portion even though i wasnt full but ill absolutely revisit here but will try small portions from now on because the taste is nice and unique all in all i recommend trying it out
really amazing dish its really rich in tastes and also very accurate all the ingredients and portions are fitting perfectly
delicious and huge shawarma its like a deluxe shawarma because added extra things like tomato and stuff very nice staff
what an amazing place ive been having vegan falafels and they are delightful the staff and the owner is very knowledgeable in what they do and are aware of vegan restrictions non vegan food is also available though i havent tried it overall a definite recommendation especially if you crave a great falafel thank you ps picture is of buckwheat falafel wrap
really fresh and tasty kebabs and kebab plates staff are super nice too
i have visited and lived in several arab countries i experienced a real arabic food same as the one when i was in those arabic countries especially shawarma was very delicious im planning to visit this restaurant very soon to experienced other arabic cuisines as well
the food was so good we had dinner there on our first day at thamel and instantly decided to visit this place again before catching our flight fulfilling tasty food within budget worth every penny
awesome place to have doner if you want to go with tastegreat service too i recommended to visit all if you are in ktm
we had fries a veg and a nonveg shawarma and the portions were too good it doesnt taste the same as it used to a year ago they could add a bit of sauce in the fillings but other than that its good to go my favorite shawarma place for sure

small street side place focused on providing great food and customer service i visited on a late evening unsure of what to order the owner was patient and made a few suggestions he was enthusiastic and proud to share the flavours of his menu i had a very good experience ordering and the food itself was very good i regretted not being able to order a nd kebab the next day as my time in nepal was coming to an end
positives food is tasty good portion as well also the staff are wonderful negatives poor sitting arrangements also not very clean chicken donor seems to have little chicken mostly fries lettuce etc why serve on a thin plastic plate thing is beyond me its in very poor taste all in all quite overpriced would not recommend
really great falafel chicken doner wraps staff is genial helpful and quick to laugh and talk prices are exceedingly fair portions enough to share great for a quick bite in thamel sit in or take to go

nice snatched dinning place at the back of this little restaurant where you get to eat taameah falafel and shawermakebab although the food was delicious i had a very terrible stomachache and diarrhea that night local muslims told me it is known not to be halal food
thamel is best place for night out

ate falafel the evening before we did the everest base camp trek it was delicious and a high value for money for sure fuelled me mentally for the coming two weeks
delicious not too greasy full of flavor try it
mojar
very tasty kabaab
one of the best shawarma i had in india very close to authentic taste the owner is very passionate dedicated small shop by good taste and best service keep it up guys
almost most of the items in their menu are awesome and doner kebab is the best one one must try
at first i thought the place had only one table by the side of the road but they have a sitting area inside the building the taste was refreshing as it had tons of vegetables and vinegar soaked carrots and beetroot and hot sauce on the side i found the french fries a little too much in the filling but few and small chicken pieces
the shwarma was just ok lacked the authentic taste
unfortunately i already had the best falafel wrap in pokhara so i couldnt help but compare this one was of its size and didnt have much fresh veggies which i think a good falafel wrap has still the taste was good just not what i expected
the price cant be beat for the delicious food serving size is huge highly recommend
the chicken wraps here are the best thing i ate here in kathmandu the man that worked there could be the owner im not sure was also really friendly
nice place good halal food and cooking good price cannot have enough good quantity and quality
lovely dishes freshly prepared quality products
delicious wraps quick and friendly service highly recommended
the sabich wrap was perfectly blended with adequate amount of sauces boiled eggs falafels and hummus the platter was also up to the mark and the prices are apt with the food
very wonderful and delicious
delicious food at an affordable price
falafel wrap and chicken wrap were everything we wanted and more crispy falafel amazing flavor crammed pack with tasty sauce and veggies the off road seating area was quiet and intimate not to mention serving size was huge great bang for your buck totally recommend

amazing food highly recommended friendly owner
really good chicken doner i was craving it after a long trek in the mountains did not disappoint
excellent food big meals very recommended and there is an option for gluten free
this place really hit the spot great prices and great food
best place in kathmandu for authentic for shawarma ram dai the place owner is also a very good and humble owner never lets me down with their food if you are looking for a scrumptious shawarma meal than this is the place
my favorite place to eat in thamel the food has never been short of amazing the service is always fast and the location is also convenient next to hotel manang and hotel marsyangdi my goto items on the menu are chicken shawarma and falafel wrap
excellent food nice people
small place not much to look at however the food is okay and not bad for thamel pricing they use olive oil to make food which isnt something i havent seen before in restaurants the falafel wraps are huge yak cheese tahini baba ganoush and more as extra which is nice
i had a very high expectation from the place well the taste of the shawarma and their service exceeded my expectations the best place for shawarma they care so much about the authenticity without compromising their customers taste at the same time affordable good portion balanced taste too clean kind and gentle people will definitely keep visiting again and again highly recommended
good place for meat lovers
delicious affordable and huge portion
delicious chicken doner and falafels with awesome owners totally worth trying as i dont think theres anything similar in ktm go give them some love
doner is pretty nice
large kebabs full of flavor their lassis are tasty too
maybe i had way higher expectations or maybe it became soggy as i had one to go i did not enjoy it as much i had expected the sauce was not consistently spread or something i felt the balance was off will try again just to confirm
its is not like kebab in europe it is more like a turkish durum but it tastes so good and the poeple are so nice that it deserves points i was this time in week kathmandu already twice eating here
very good falafel must try for vegans
i went in here cause i wanted to try shawarma i had medium spicy chicken shawarma for rupees updated which i didnt find it expensive at all the staffs were really hospitable asking for review when i was about to make the payment i really loved this place and i will visit this place again for other tastes as well i highly recommend this place period
good allround option
bolshoy vkusnyy i svezhiy doner mesto uyutnoe i priyatnoe ceny ne zavysheny i dazhe deshyovye dlya takogo razmera porcii
the best restuarant to go when you are extremely hungry good food at best prices fastest service
best value for money restaurant great taste healthy food really nice staffs they actually care about the experience customers have one of the fewest places in kathmandu where i feel like i am getting the best out of what i am paying for love the falafel wrap veg as a vegeterian
very juicy and big doner kebabs but my favourite is their avocado hummus plate with fries and falafel
very delicious food

probably the best place in nepal for shawarmakebabs and falafels located on the way to sorhakhuttey from satghumti this place definitely deserves all the too ratings it has for the quality quantity hospitality and taste you get for the affordable prices here a must visit highly recommended
service was great food was made fresh to order the falafel wrap was very tasty and was a large portion

very cute place and nice owner as in israeli it felt good coming here and having spme home food at friday night the hummus and falafal were surprisingly alright we had a small talk about tkhynh hr brkh good place
its a small lebanese food outlet with a downsized menu after the lockdown i went with friends and they tried chicken shawarma which as per their feedback was not great i tried veg platter of pita bread hummus and felafell it was good overall experience was average and food was also average
amazing falafel warp quantity was enough

really good food and freshly squeezed juice small place that i walked past a few times before seeing it but well worth the effort of finding it
the food is delicious unfortunately they havent been open for two weeks
bon kebab rien dexceptionnel non plus different du kebab parisien lol
i had the chicken doner rupees and got it medium spicy which surprised me how spicy it was food was delicious affordable and large they have a small dining room located down the alley and bring things down when ready if you dont get it to go great stop in kathmandu
holy moly that was as good as the reviews suggested
fulfilling and worth the prize the pickled vegetables jalepenos and bullet chillis was something you wouldnt easily get at other falafel place and its makes the falafel so much better also it gives city vibes when you eat at the small spot just adjacent to the entrance
awesome falafel hummus and chicken shawarma very very nicely prepared with all fillings while they were preparing i could see their live preparation with cleanliness thanks a lot for serving such a delicious arabic food here in thamel we did not miss our hometown muscat
delicious huge sizes value for money will come here again
comida boa barata e os atendentes fazem de tudo para te agradar fui varias vezes
good staff try ginger turmeric wellness shots
visited this establishment based on the good reviews on google i was not disappointed opted for the chicken doner wrap spicy it was very nice and i fully recommend this place to others

their falafels are delicious and the staff are friendly and efficient prices are really reasonable too
this place is unbelievable i lived in kathmandu for years and ate here twice a week anything is good but stongly suggest the wrap but dont leave without hummus take an extra item back to your hotel
this food is def top on my best food ive ever had in my life list
excellent food and service best falafel in nepal

very delicious pizza the kitchen is open which is always good i ordered the pizza funghi with extra of pesto sause delicious the taste of the tomato sause and cheese proportion is great the crust thin and crispy recommended
the food taste goodstuff are helpful
superb quality and finsing work
quite an unpleasant customer service
delicious pizza and nice service pizza was at the table minutes after ordered we all loved it and will be back for sure
i have been customer of this place for a decade pizza is awesome here but last week i was in thamel i was there for shopping parked my vehicle in underground parking my urine bladder was full tried to reach out for the washroom to my surprise the owner was on the front door he was so rude it was such a disappointment i will forever regret eating their pizza
worst pizza i ever had worst a raspberry mocktail with power services
highly recomended to other people
this is the pizzeria i would recommend anyone visiting thamel to go and have their pizza at the food was incredibly tasty and the ambience just added to it really loved the experience and would highly recommend it

came here for a fancy dinner on a busy saturday night the service was extremely good with us getting a table almost immediately we had a pizza carbonara spaghetti and the tiramisu with cocktails the cocktails were really good and so was the tiramisu the service was extremely good with waiters offering to refill our drinks and sharing suggestions on desserts we were the last ones to leave highly recommend this place for an experience of fine dining with a sprinkle of latenight grub food
not like real pizza but fun atmosphere and great staff
thankyou for your response i am not denying what happened but their tone and the way they spoke was what made us upset we understand the difference between being nice and rude if it was just me i would have not said anything but everyone felt the same we were not aware about the rules had this been said politely we wouldnt have any issue we wouldve gladly accepted were at fault
the pizza here has become bland and tasteless there are lots of new pizza place like sicily roadhouse cafe pizza hut that provide much better quality pizza in my opinion
nice place to go after trekking for some good pizza service is a little slow and inattentive but still good
excellent place for pizza lovers and cocktails in kathmandu must recommended
hadnt been here in years bright and clean ambience a sense of happiness in the air very attentive polite and helpful staff the pizza menu was diverse and the outcome was tasty the pizza was wetter than ideal for my taste and issue i have experienced with road house as well nepal really needs to add ginger beer not just ginger ale to the menu this would be a game changer to any pizza joint and restaurant the italian salad was very fresh and tasty the potato chips were soso
we came from india not expected this kind of rude behavior
the pizza was delicious no doubt about that however the staff was very rude and lacked basic etiquette i went there with my friends from india and all of us were quite disappointed with how we were treated the staff spoke impolitely and the overall atmosphere was unwelcoming its unfortunate because the food was great but i wouldnt visit again due to the poor customer service a good experience is about more than just the food
food is nice but the staffs are very very rude they do not have manners and the way they talk is not nicee i would not like to visit such places i would rather prefer going on the place which has decent taste but where staffs are polite
the ambience of fire and ice is classic its one of a kind in nepal now lets talk about the food i was utterly disappointed by the level of food that was served the whole purpose of my visit as a vegetarian critique to this place was the taste the elegance of pizza that nepal has to offer but no my expectations was shattered by how plain the food was pizza the crust was fine but it seemed as though the crust was just an elevated version of roti a classic nepali staple no it doesnt go with the taste of pizza second it was very bland where is the pizza sauce blended tomato is not pizza sauce it was almost nonexistent now i ordered the classic fire and ice pizza and what did i get an elevated version of roti with tomato sauce topped with cheese and potato and two drops of pesto potato seriously in a pizza as a staple no i have had fire and ice before it was sublime i still remember the incredible taste they had to offer a decade ago and now to think that the quality has degraded as such its a shame chips what i have never tasted anything so bland i couldnt even finish it and the sauce it came with abysmal you got to realize that you cant simply pair two things and call it a dish cost is reasonable as international standard kitchen paying for a full portion of chips is entirely reasonable but come on at least make a little effort in making the dish a little better i would never recommend the fancy french name hidden bland potato chips to anyone overall the ambience of the place and server is good but im sorry going here for food especially in todays standard is not worth it at all in one word disappointed
had the imported ham mushroom added some garlic was actually very good going to try the calzone today you will not be disappointed
i visited this place with a friend who introduced me to her new yoga group there were seven of us and the restaurant was perfect for a larger gathering to be honest i didnt expect to find such authentic italian pizza in this area but i did i truly enjoyed my margherita sipping on an aperol spritz and sharing stories about life and travel with people i had just met the staff were incredibly friendly helpful and attentive the warm inviting atmosphere makes it easy to relax connect and enjoy great italian food its also easy to find just turn off the main street and look for the sign check the photo i added for reference highly recommended
some of the best pizza you will find in nepal probably the best pizza you will find km from kathmandu great atmosphere amazing toppings and the crust is thin firm and droopy when it needs to be it is almost like annapurna herself has blessed this pizzaria this is the spot i go to after a long weeks work in the himalayas because it feels like home
one of the best italian restaurants in nepal i was pleasantly surprised by the crust and dough of the pizza authentic and light the pizzas were excellent while the vegetarian lasagna was just okay the atmosphere doesnt feel like you are in nepal although it was a bit noisy for my taste prices are a little high by nepal standards but the quality makes it worth it a great spot for italian food in kathmandu
para as referencias locais a pizza e bem boa talvez a melhor da cidade mas e cara para os padroes locais
ive visited this restaurant multiple times as a casual customer but today in a moment of real urgency i was rudely denied access to the restroom it wasnt just disappointingit was inhumane basic decency and compassion were completely missing i hope the management reflects on what hospitality truly means
worst pizza ever had no cripsy nothing felt like we are eating chapati topped with veggies and pasta was uncooked
loved the smoothie pizza never goes wrong here
great pizza in kathmandu very busy restaurant so book or go early
this is the best service ive had in nepal for a month pizza was really good and overall id highly recommend this place
the pizza was yummy it was perfect people there were so fun and nice and i loved the ambiance
great pizza
very good quality pizza good staff and great atmosphere
full of great atmosphere and food excellent place to meet with friends a little crowded so make sure to come early if you can
best pizza in kathmandu
the best place for spaghetti and margaritas
me lo ricordavo molto piu di alto livello il cambio di gestione non ha giovato
pizza meravigliosa
great pizza if you like proper pizza quick and delicious
a classic but the pizza was not really exceptional and prices are high atmosphere is nice but too crowded not enough space between tables
great service really good thin pizza crust a pizza will cost you good vibe nice variety of drinks alcoholic drinks shakes smoothies
pizza excellente un peu bruyant
tras un buen rato esperando vemos como adelantan a una pareja que llega mas tarde dando palique al de la entrada otra pareja que estaba antes y nosotros nos quejamos para mi es una falta de respeto que no compensa si las pizzas estan buenas nos marchamos sin entrar
me encanta este lugar
great pizza la regina was tasty and lots of mocktail options the blackcurrant mocktail was quite sweet very busy on a saturday evening with a long wait but luckily no wait when we arrived at pm good service
amazing homemade gnocchi
decent food atmosphere service
love the pizza only place where i feel pizza is healthy

authentic pizza in kathmandu perfect crust chili oil on the table adds the perfect heat
wow one of finnest pizza hut in ktmt
loved the pizza unlike other authentic italian pizza joints their crust was the perfect balance of not being so thick doughy but being dense enough to carry the toppings plus the crust alone is quite flavorful crispy the soft topped center the robust crust balances perfectly
rude behaviour
great pizza but rs for an orange juice
zhao pai pi sa zhi you tu douzhao pai yi mian xiang shi ti qian zhu hao de fang bian mian
cucina italiana molto curata ingredienti di qualita la signora annamaria titolare ha creato un posticino veramente coccoloso
se sei a katmandu e hai voglia di pizza devi assolutamente provare questo ristorante certo non siamo ai livelli delle migliori pizzerie italiane ma la qualita dei prodotti la cottura della pizza e la cortesia del personale di sala sono stati una bella sorpresa
this is quite a popular italian restaurant and comes highly recommended the staff are helpful and on top of their game the antipasti is amazing as was the potato chips we had a ricotta pizza as well as the tuna pizza which were both great lively place with great vibes
the only problem i had was i couldnt find french fries on the menu other than that it was perfect kudos to the boy who recommended barahsinghe when we asked for his favourite beer its our favourite as well now
wonderful gluten free pizza place we had brilliant interactions on both occasions with staff and trying to speak the nepali language please be respectful as always in nepal and dont be rude and rowdy with outwards behaviours enjoy the food enjoy the experiences and make sure to generously tip in cash as the staff make every effort to deliver dont be a scrooge in fact anywhere in nepal
i decided to visit once more for one last chance the result was burnt pizza worse every time expensive prices from italy
schade das der service nicht zum ambiente und leckerem essen passt leider ist man trotz das es eins der gehobeneren restaurants in kathmandu ist sehr unflexibel pizza belege konnen nicht gewechselt werden beim kids menu gibt es nur eine sorte an pizza es kann kein anderer belag genommen werden das ganze wird ziemlich desinteressiert heruber gebracht die pizzen und salat allerdings muss man eingestehen sind richtig gut

decent pizza could be tastier we had two different pizzas that tasted very similarly nice place though
yesfire and ice pizzeria is definitely one of the best spots for pizza in thamel their classic italianstyle pizzas fresh ingredients and cozy ambiance make it a favorite among both locals and tourists
best pizza in nepal
great food great service the owner made us feel very welcome
the best pizza in kathmandu the food service and prices are good been here times a week during my stay in nepal the straff are nice helpful and funny didnt wait long for my food give this out of
a nice and lively place for pizza and drinks their coffee mousse was so good would recommend that
best pizza ive ever had must must visit
even it is a bit expensive in nepal but it definitely worth good value of money if you stay nepal for long time and miss some europe food i definitely recommend here the margaritas is the best
good service n average food
was there on opening day way back when still crave the spaghetti puttanesca and the pizza even though i moved away from nepal visited after years and the taste was still the same keep on keeping on family
amazing service the staff anticipated every need and were very friendly and efficient i ordered a pizza and the brownie with ice cream for dessert they were both pretty tasty and i also enjoyed my lemon soda lemon juice with soda water very refreshing the restaurant was fairly empty when i arrived but filled up during my meal creating a warm atmosphere with a bit of buzz id recommend it as a pleasant and convenient place to eat with reliably good food and commend the staff on outstanding customer service if i could have given them stars for this i would have
best pizza in kathmandu
pizza is the best here and i usually go for half and half option picture below is half pepperoni and half ettore basically minced chicken with sundried tomatoes for vegetarian mates paesana is super yummy that comes with zucchini spinach and mozzarella seating is completely indoors with some seats next to windows overlooking temples nearby paid parking also available
pizza were great and good service
oh this has to be one of those overrated food joints made popular by the tourists for some reason the food was average the pizza tasted weird something wrong with the dough even though they claim its freshly made their speciality of fried chips is so bland youd need a tub of salt just so its palatable the salsa that comes along with it is more like a green store bought paste not at all fresh or tasty there are much better authentic italian food joints in the surrounding area a place called vera pizza for eg was amazing
as a foreigner in this country with a pizza pampered palate i would say this is the best pizza in ktm
typical thin crust but i love the pizzas more at the ktm outlet
been here days in a row its very good
great service friendly
worst pizza i have ever had toppings were bare minimum and onion lekhera boiled potato halera deko thiyo
pollo pizza was one of the worst pizzas i have ever had says fresh onion but u put boiled potatoes very bad experience
my daughters and i visited this place on our first night in kathmandu based on fairly good reviews in google map and also since it is very close to the hotel we are staying at oasis kathmandu hotel we ordered salad potatoes margherita pizza and alio olio pasta all was good except the pasta was a bit bland the service was excellent and the atmosphere was good the only thing is that the price is a bit on the expensive side nevertheless it was a good meal
cozy setting paired with its excellent service creates a pleasant dining experience its a mustvisit for anyone craving italian cuisine in kathmandu
an oftenvisited italian restaurant with consistent food for the most part except for the softy icecream which lately does not have the same quality less vanilla flavor service is fast without compromising on the taste nice ambience favorites include rompipalle pizza potato chips made inhouse and nutella crepes
very nice place plenty of traditional pizzeria options
pizza meno buona del previsto buoni ingredienti ma pasta e lievitazione non eccezionali sapore poco deciso cornicione non bombato una pizza liscia meglio di altre ma un po delusi
staff was friendly food was authentic especially the pizza and tiramisu soft serve ice cream was not bad but the cone leaked alot
tried fire and ice during our nepal visit one of the best place to have pizza
we were really craving italian food after spending a few weeks in asia and this place did not disappoint we went a few times and tried different pasta and pizza dishes everything was very nicely made and tasty but i would especially recommend the pizzas the place is constantly busy and often has a queue to enter it seems to be a place with lots of international customers the service is extremely good efficient and quick
amazing pizza with perfect crust
i recently dined at fire and ice pizzeria upon arrivai i was greeted by a staff member asked for table occupancy and escorted to a table professional the welcoming cozy ambiance with all of the hallmark achievements of the place as well as rules for the customers surely set the perfect tone for a meal one of the highlights was the menu overwhelming in a good way offering a fantastic variety of pizzas including traditional tastes and unique specialty options making it hard to choose just one also they have great vegetarian whole wheat substitute glutenfree options that sparked my curiosity and i looked for help from the servers in the restaurant they seemed disinterested the menu knowledge was and the recommendations felt unhelpful order eat go for antipasti i ordered bruschetta the chopped tomatoes olives were well seasoned with herbs garlic the cream of tomato soup tangy creamy paired with fresh baked bread was an perfect appetizer before our meal perfect start now lets talk about the pizza i decided to try their signature pizzarompipalle a classic margherita paired with spicy meat sauce coriander and chilies the crust was thin crispy the sauce flavorful and the toppings fresh and generous making each bite a delightful experience for mains i tried the zucchini risotto and omg the rice was cooked to perfection al dente the creamy texture of the arborio rice combined with the natural sweetness of the pumpkin mama mia to top it all off i couldnt resist trying their homemade chocolate brownie with ice cream for dessert a perfectly baked fudgy brownie with a crunch from the walnuts paired with softserve gelato was the perfect end to our meal overall fire ice pizzeria is a mustvisit for anyone who loves pizza authentic italian food their commitment to quality is something to praise i cant wait to try more of their menu grazie per lesperienza
ok pizza because the place was jam packed so maybe not my type plus the reviews are great
hands down best firewood pizza of kathmandu its really crowded but the wait is worth it definitely recommend this place
this restaurant have good food but cant do meeting or small celebration very less privacy very close sitting arrangements
good pizza good lasagna lunch time probably is not a good judgement of their atmosphere loved it
tasty food with really big portions quick service friendly staff and cosy atmosphere definitely recommend to visit this place
best for pasta
pizzas normales buena masa pero productos sin demasiado sabor como la de quesos
the best pizza ever
the wood fired pizza here is fantastic delicious base sauce and toppings service is fast too and all food is very reasonably priced highly reccomened this pizza bar
pizzas good chips not so good big rat alert hygiene concerns

best place for pizza in nepal they have been running that restaurant from very long time if you are looking for breakfast lunch or dinner its a must go place
not bad for a pizza in nepal
nice pizzas being in nepal its quite complicated to find some of them and here they prepare it relly fine i will come back for sure
the dining area was a bit congested and i would have preferred chairs instead of stools and benches prices were expensive imo the lasagna tasted good but nothing special pasta sheets were a bit unevenly cooked some places had a bit more chew to it than the rest i would have preferred more sauce between the pasta sheet the price was over priced on par with the serving of food imo the mocktail was too sour for my taste second visit though the pizza was pricey it was one of the best i had the base was soft and crunchy but flat imo i would have preferred to have some structure to it plenty of condiments the sauce was slightly sweet and went well with other condiments the sausage was disappointing unfortunately the pizza was really cheesy and so far it has been the only place where i vot stringy cheese
lasagne here is really good must try food pizza was average canzone was also okayish pasta was really good worth a try if you want to try some new food items
good pizza and best affogato
food tastes awesome loves the pizzas only concern is the quantity of dips served
ordered carbonara ended up getting scrambled eggs with pasta worst
not bad
beautiful place with best pizza on the world

if you are craving a good italian food you found it for nepal they did an excellent job we ordered pizza and lasagna and both were good but their amore mio dessert is on another level its so good
wonderful pizza great lady anna
best pizza in katmandu
no me gusto no regresaria el servicio es malo pedi ensalada caprese que estaba rica y un calzone que no tenia buen sabor se tardaron horas en atendernos se equivocaron en la orden de las personas con las que iba pedimos la cuenta y nunca nos la llevaron tuvimos que pararnos a pedirla el lugar tiene buen ambiente esta lleno de extranjeros
super expensive and not tasty service was great though
loved it
visited a couple of times tried the mushroom pizza and veggie chilli pasta all good
skvela stylova pizzeria chutna hubova polievka
for years the best place for a pizza and bruschetta
i tried different pizzas there my favourite is still margarita their bruschetta is a must try id say the service is quick and efficient the place can be a bit more well ventilated
we dined as a group of everyone enjoyed their pizza and drinks one of our group required gluten free and that was very easy we also had a couple of members with several food allergies and they were able to find suitable options on the menu and not miss out
fire and ice was our favorite restaurant at kathmandu we even ended up going back we normally dont do this while traveling we were amazed by the staff and their exceptional service the pizza itself was amazing but the rondelle di patate fritte was from another world
real unique italian restaurant good
just the best
the pizza is good the first courses are just enough quick and kind service recommended for those who are fed up with garlic rice and lentils
incredible pizzeria in katmandus city the place the staff and the food are amazing if you are around the city you should go and enjoy the place
excellent italian food the price fits the quality
zeer charmante eigenaresse fantastisch eten was hier jaar geleden ook is nog steeds een geweldige plek eigenaresse weet het beste van wat italie te bieden heeft aan te bieden in nepal echte aanrader
they asked for the bill to be paid before hand even before serving the order which is i think highly disrespectful towards the customers
we ate in this pub right after our ebc trek which means weeks of strictly lodges foods and tea no need to say we were amazed by the remembrance of italian food and tastes you should definitely check it out
ottimo posto per pizza a kathmandu
very nice place i had a great pizza and cappuccino
their pizzas are really good thin crust with loads of toppings that were really good their pasta omg so creamy and delicious loved it the ambience felt like im in a classic pizzeria place
el mejor restaurante de thammel
very delicious impressive
a kathmandu legend which is well deserved as the pizzas are fabulous they serve other things but pizza is the big one very quick service great atmosphere worth booking at busy times or be prepared to queue evenings are always busy
ich war drei wochen vor ort und habe das restaurant als gelungene abwechslung zur typischen nepalesischen kuche empfunden schones ambiente sehr netter und pfiffiger service und sehr leckere und hochwertige speisen und getranke gemischtes publikum bei durchaus etwas hoheren preisen die aber in relation absolut passend sind
amazing pizza thin crust tasty filling super fast service and very friendly staff very happy with the dinner
ottima pizzeria a kathmandu sapendo che si sta in nepal la pizza e niente male
the best place for pizza in ktm the risotto is also amazing
best pizza in town great atmosphere
very nice place to get a pizza before or after mountain trip service was fast pizza delicious and fair price i also have a nice tiramisu really recommend this place
we went with family for fire ice pizzeria it was crowded but still nice we ordered pizza cabonara pasta lasagna pizza was the best i could smell the strong egg in carbonate which should not be the case and i missed some more cheese in carbonate lasagna was ok yet still delicious we didnot reserve the place but waiters were nice to prove place for people thankyou so much
undoubtedly great pizza with a chique vibe
great pizza and friendly staff a must visit when in kathmandu
best pizza in town
delicious
namaste after more than days of walking in the mountains the god of food guided ud towards this hiden gem the pizza is well made and full of flavour the sauces are tasty and the staff is most kind i felt a taste of home in a beautiful city
my friend who is a frequent visitor to nepal was raving about this place and we tried it out on our last day in nepal the pizza was simply sensational and the arabiatta penne pasta was simple but flavourful too
very good restaurant very tasty pizza i have not expected that we find in kathmandu restaurant european teaste
good pastas and pizza serving sizes are reasonable and the staff are friendly
this place was introduced to me by a friend their pizzas and pasta are good extensive menu and attentive servers
great staff very clean restaurant nice authentic ingredients for pizzas costs more for a pizza here than to buy one in australia
nothing can beat their food quality so consistent fresh and out of this world must try when in kathmandu
food was just ok waited really long mins for food although people before us got food first servers were very polite and nice though maybe management needs to look at ways to help chef during rush hours
only ambience is goodrest food i mean pizza is pathetic
best pizza i ate ever
thin crust pizza that was better than most of what i ate in naples
excellent pizza great attentive service
apart from the dessert everything was great
was the best pizza in town going back after few years and getting a mitigate feeling not like beforehand
great staff great food great service margherita pizza was very good good neapolitan style would highly recommend to anyone looking to try some authentic neapolitan style pizza
one of the best place in kathmandu for neopolitan pizza every bite is priceless
we were served burnt leftover pizza and eggs on stale bread tost very disappointed this place lack professionalism even though the owner came to talk to us and refund all the money and compliment my daughter with an icecream we left all the refunded money as tips to very un professional staff the dont deserve another visit dont go there if you speak nepali and if you look like nepali they judge you by your face and the language you speak otherwise i see no reason to serve burnt leftover pizza and bread to toast i dont know who made that decision either lazy staff or the management but for a hungry costumer healthy testy food in comfortable friendly environment is the most important thing not an apology i guess they dont need local business support the server even told us not to feed my daughter the muffin i bought from next door himalayan and my wife had to stop feeding her even though she was hungry and refused to eat their burnt pizza such a horrible place to be chao
been to italy the pizzas here are better than there been my most favourite forever
love de pizza n barhasingha g atmosphere
a great place for authentic pizza always get a table staff quick food fast pizza excellent one to keep on your list for visiting kathmandu
having been one of annamarias very first customers in jan whilst living in nepal i was really excited to return to fi and see if the pizzas lived up to my memories yes the pizzas were still good and the choice expanded greatly a crisp base a decent size and a nice amount of topping the bruschetta was also fresh and used good quality tasty tomatoes however the evening was let down somewhat by the curt and rather surly service by indira also sadly the tiramisu was a huge disappointment it needed a stronger coffee flavour and there was not even the merest hint of white rum that it supposedly contained maybe it was just an off night
le restaurant italien emblematique de thamel ou l on se retrouve avec plaisir apres un trekking ou une visite dans la vallee de kathmandu le personnel est poli et efficace et la cuisine est un vrai regal avec un grand choix de pizzas grand format des salades delicieuses sans parler des desserts
pizzas tasted yummy here we liked that its thin crusted they have a wide selection of food and drinks but the aglio olio carbonara is normal the restaurant is a popular spot for tourists and their pricing is very reasonable will definitely come back for their pizzas
i have never been offered separate seasonings when eating pizza but after i tried the pizza i knew why unfortunately it was tasteless my wifes pasta was just as poorly seasoned we had really imagined it would be different
amazing if youre going to have pizza while in kathmandu this is the place to go
ive gotta say this is the best italian food that ive found in kathmandu thus far i had a pasta carbonara for dinner and it was quite alright the atmosphere was also authentic so if you wanna enjoy some italian food go here
pizza is not good
they need to improve the service hospitality despite of good name good food the hospitality needs to be better re i asked for take aways pizzas and then ask them to keep the chutneys different they staughton denied they dont give it and when i went there i person and ask waiter he gave me so such hospitality should be constant
amazing staff great foodvery kind and accomodating ordered margherita pizza lasagna traditionale calzone pizza for my friend and his familyloved it wish this restaurant more success and blessings
nog steeds een fantastische plaats om te eten klasse
awesome
crowded but cozy ambience
probably some of the best pizza ive had anywhere
i called for a pizza takeaway and when i reached the restaurant for the pizza i found out the staff never even placed the ordermy time and money was wastedi went straight to kfc after that cuz of your stupid mistakeyour staff at the reception didnt even say sorryi know you treat only foreign customers really goodpls train your staffs properlyi have been eating at your restaurant for more than yearsafter this i am never coming back
tres bonne experience on a super bien mange personnel super agreable qui parle bien anglais je recommande a les plats sont super bon
nous sommes venus en famille enfants et ans nous y avons mange fois durant notre sejour a katmandou ambiance sympathique serveurs agreables et grands choix dans les plats prix corrects
will come back soon
one of the best places to have pizza or pasta in ktm the entrance of this place doesnt look too inviting theres a parking lot and a sign but inside it looks nice they have a good menu and use good ingredients everything was fresh surprisingly good tiramisu

expensive but worth it
overpriced and terrible pizza delivery never eating there againordered twice could have gone to pepe pizza and got better taste in cheaper pricefirstly i thought it was foodmandu so tried again but pizza was terrible and the staffs who received my complaint literally were finding it funny and giggling at my complaints it was so bad i could hardly eat one slice of it and dumped the rest of itthe pictured pizza cost you a rs seriously i think they only serve better pizza to tourist not local customers

one of the best pizza to have
amazing pizza in town
lovely veg pizza risotto n pasta staff not so friendly they dont serve water unless asked they do not accept inr
it is very good the pasta and pizza was very delicious it is very recommended to all of you to take a try
it is a late review i visited the place with two other friends on march this year heard good things about the restaurant online before traveling to nepal and wanted to explore it ourselves it was overall a good experience the ambience was nice they got a good number of different options on the menu one of my friends follows a strict dietary choice yet we found something to suit us all the pizza we ordered tasted good the service was good and friendly too the price may seem a bit high on the scale however considering everything it was a good spend it rained a lot that evening that added a special charm to the atmosphere of the dinner we had there i would recommend the place
i had an amazing handmade icecream here
beautiful vibes and so yumm pizza
mucho mejor que muchas pizzas de italia buenisimo servicio un descubrimiento si despues de dias comiendo nepali te apetece una pizza y ensalada
delicious food in a bustling establishment with an alpine lodging style interior fantastic
amazing pizza try the fire and ice good friendly service and quick
pizza was really nice
the place is so amazing the potato chips and mojeto is a must and great the pizza is so delicious and amazing but they need to put more souce and cheese souce is like light in pizza but still worth to come and eat again we add more souce to the pizza and they charge us which should be free its a tomato souce little bit expansive but worth it
pizza base needs improvement kind of soggy and portion of meat in pizza should be more one small piece of salami in a slice of pizza is not heard of or see anywhere
the pizza dough is super i liked their thin crunch type of pizza slice which is amazing worth eating there
tastewise it same as roadhouse pizza pizza was good obviously but rs for lemon sprite ice and few mint leaves mojito is crazyyy had to try anyway to check if there is something special about it nope its the same as the one you get at half of the price and why dont you have ketchup too fancy for ketchup eh
great pizza and also lasagne price is good i think one of the best pizza out side brazil rs
the best pizza in kathmandu
every plate is absolutely favorite
el menjar estava molt botot i que a un preu ja europeu i no de nepal de fettots els clients eren extrangers una mica lents en el servei i el lloc molt sorollosvaig estar a punt de demanar que la pizza me la posessin en una capsa i marxarde tant soroll
one of the best pizzeria i have been outside rio grande do sul brazil love it
great spot great pizza
worst service
the pizza was ok not the best i had but decent the service was not so great and it took a long time for the pizza to come the atmosphere was a little noisy and the temperature too hot end of may dont like to sound whining it was ok but not great
worst place that i ever been i was waiting for someone so i just ordered fresh juice the price was the service was terrible the waiter girl was constantly looking so awkwardly i couldnt even stand sitting there for min even didnt finish my whole drink the service people need to be humble enough to welcome guest not like this worst place for service
the pizza was delicious the place is a bit congested but its fine
this restaurant is the top pizza parlor in town offering around varieties of pizza with authentic italian flavors besides pizza they serve delicious traditional italian dishes like pasta and spaghetti bolognese making it a mustvisit for italian cuisine lovers
a great place to grab a pizza or pasta meal nepali offerings also available its a busy bustling place with a vibrant atmosphere staff are busy but efficient and friendly consistently good food
best pizza we ever had
the pizza here is average unfortunately a pizza not to come back for weve been here twice because of an appointment unfortunately the dough is too dry and there is a lack of seasoning the second time we were here it was unfortunately a disaster the pizza was even drier it tasted like nothing we suspect that because the place was too full the pizzas lost a lot in a hurry we had to wait longer for the pizzas when it was less busy it is very loud and very warm in the restaurant despite the air conditioning you can pay by card there is parking in front of the door
the crust was crunchy and the toppings were plentiful was this the best pizza ive ever had no but it is also a nice alternative to all of the momo and thalis that im sure you are all having here the place was quite full with both tourists and locals in attendance
really enjoyed the food mocktails and icecream here well located in the shopping district near aloft hotel star service
really nice place with pizza like in europe the restaurant is also very nice and not to busy
pastas and pizzas were excellent
very good food and nice services
a great downtown place in thamel stands out from the rest with its history and on point service we were ushered in by a very attentive and hands on concierge and the experience was just wonderful we tried their ettore pizza followed by a calzone and their signature dessert amore mio with ice cream i loved how airy the bread was and all fluffy in the crust a very satisfying pizza indeed the calzone was the highlight for us the stuffing was bloody good the amore mio was basically a small calzone with what seemed like a nutella type stuffing went great with the ice cream id certainly recommend it to those visiting the vibe of the place is very laid back cozy and welcoming

great pizza and pasta
harika bir yer

we orders a vegetarian pizza which was just ok as it was a little bit burnt and overpriced at over rs i have had better rs pizzas although not as large as this i wanted some water with the pizza and they supplied a ml bottle with their logo on it for rs the bottle had a mrp on it for rs the place seems very popular however it will not include a return visit from my side
good pizza
verkochtes essen service versucht sich heraus zu reden wirklich sehr sehr enttauscht
couldnt be better came here times during my time in nepal great food service and generally friendly vibes highly recommend
great place and amazing food
food as always nice but for summer time felt bit crowded and hot would be nice to get some cool air while we enjoy our company and fooddrinks
id heard so much about this place and everyone constantly recommended it good pizzas for sure we really enjoyed the soft yet crunch base however the place is a bit too pricey good place for a nice dinner and i would still recommend if youre in the mood for some italian food to cut through the thalis and momos
lovely pizzas
best pizza in kathmandu
first off looking at the crowd in the restaurant one may think its a really good restaurant but that really is not the case once shown to the table you are not asked about your order until you call someone to come and take the order we had ordered garlic focaccia bread first and it was good but most of the pieces had no garlic on them when approaching the manager about it they just gave us garlic oil instead of providing us with minced garlic okay after that we had a half and half pizza one side margherita and the other side i dont remember but was just two lines below margherita on the menu and it was very mediocre give that it was a neapolitan pizza restaurant i was expecting there to be fresh mozzarella or cut up mozzarella instead of the grated kind after that we had gnocchi in a butter sauce which was actually pretty good and then we had a aglio e olio pasta dish which was completely and trust me when i say completely it was literally just pasta and olive oil no garlic or parsley or chilli flakes taste to it and this resulted in us asking for a sauce to go with it after that we party of three were still quite hungry so we ordered arrabbiata past and again the tomato sauce was really bland and kind of put us off the fresh orange juice was quite good but it was not cold at all and also it is not rocket science to make a good fresh orange juice i do not blame the managers or the service staff at all in this the owners and chefs need to work together to make a better cohesive menu and to educate staff in managing the restaurant
good food and friendly staff
nice pizza with nice atmosphere by the tridevi temple a pizza with two flavours is available for ordering love their sun dried tomato
place was buzzing but service was good pizzas were excellent highly recommend
good gluten free pizza the texture is a little different to a regular pizza but the taste is nice its good to find a gluten free pizza in asia both pictures are gluten free i went back cause i liked it
great pizza great staff
salad and a parma ham pizza tasty with a wholewheat crust option fast service large windows allow a lot of fresh air nice atmosphere but feels rushed the bill looks very unprofessional and no prices vat etc shown so you cant check the bill
neparudeben ge pizagashi beremasita mei wei sikatutadesu darubatonibao kitaratamanihaitarianosusumedesu
best pizza in town top service perfect for lunch not for dinner though because of the benches
starters crostini mushroom with cheese and cherry tomatoes mains margherita and rompipalle dessert chocolate walnut brownie with soft served icecream portions were all fulfilling however the sauce in rompipalle was bit bland it did not have that spicy meat sauce flavour
clasica pizzeria si vas a comer otra cosa piensalo mejor el lugar es muy bonito agradable limpio buena atencion y buenos precios
bonne pizza biere fraiche service un peu long
great selection of pizzas with a thin crust well prepared and cooked atmosphere also quite good situated at a very central place in kathmandu
the food was really tasty and portion sizes were perfect the staff were helpful and respectful the atmosphere was buzzing
the food is usually great here was visiting after long didnt find it upto the mark
la pizza etait vraiment delicieuse et le service a emporter assez rapide le prix est quand meme beaucoup trop cher dommage
good taste and open area to walk
very expensive
nice restaurant very clean friendly service fresh pressed juice and the pizza
nice restaurant very clean friendly service fresh pressed juice and the pizza wow thin tasty best i had in italy oh i am in nepal really good worth to try
its a nice experience for of us until we paid the bill we paid by cash and counted money times before gave it to a staff a few mins later staff came back and told us that the money was not enough total bill r we were so sure that we gave pieces of note the rest were notes but they brought back for us to recount it had only pieces of note left we added more money to end the discrepancy be warned if paying by cash better go to cashier and count the money with cashier
never order pizza with spinich and zucini tastes terrible went there with a veg friend thought of trying something newwhich turned out very bad i am sure other pizza would be nice
pizza is good but could develop more been here and years ago and then now just last week didnt feel it changed too much
fire and ice pizzeria is one name that everyone would remember when it comes to pizza multiple occasions have visited them for their pizza other food like lasagne etc it is a must to try when you are in kathmandu and even convenient if you are in and around thamel ambience i feel it needs more space as its mostly crowded the staff are good
excellente pizza italienne
the best italian food ive had in asia dont miss if youre in kathmandu and fancy pizza lovely atmosphere good drinks selection and great pizzas
i love to have pizza at fire and ice
nce restaurant and friendly staffs
fantastic i love it fire and ice restaurant is best choice in nepal for pizza and italian food
its one of the best place for pizzas lots of options to choose from pizzas here are really good beside pizza there are lots of other options available as well like pastas lasagna dumplings salads etc menu price is on higher side the place is usually crowded with tourists as well as locals free parking coupon provided for visiting customers
i wouldnt really say their food is authentic i ordered the prosciutto pizza and it was definitely not real prosciutto the lasagna was pretty minimal on the ragu and the cheese the waiter forgot my order of beer but still it was a nice place and the pizza itself had a good base and texture on the expensive side response to the owner id request that if youre serving different types of prosciutto then please be more clear on the menu i would say its worth debating if you say theres only one type of lasagna in italy for me and according to the types i like there i felt it was minimal on the ragu and cheese for the owners response below my review im curious as to why he felt the need to defend his food only versus the gaps in service i faced i had to call multiple waiters to get another round of beer and the waiter mixed up orders between tables and caused some confusion
wow one of the most overrated places ive been the food is sent out within min of ordering meaning that basically everything is preprepped i ordered a spaghetti bolognese and some pizzas including their signature fire and ice the spaghetti was mediocre and the pizza was horrendous soggy unsalted goop that wasnt even cut properly dont come here the signature fire and ice was even more bland and the worst thing we ate that day beware
this is the best pizza in thamel i would go back dont expect italy but its super good for kathmandu
gorgeous venue the outdoor terrace overlooks a beautiful courtyard we came for pizzas and tried out a bunch they are good however some of the recipes that should pack a lot of flavor eg la ciccia caramelized onion and sausage felt a bit dull but maybe it was just that one batch
food service and atmosphere are all good gave star because the seatings were not so comfortable
the penne
amazing pizza tasye
good place for pasta
we love the pizza here the thamel location was closed so we made a special trip to this location it did not disappoint much less crowded same great product also the small mall where it is located was fun to explore dont miss the ice cream
love this place with good food good ambience n vibes good service and very nice staff did i mention good pizzas
pizzas and lasagne are good similar to thamel the place was quite busy during dinner time and a bit long wait for food i felt like the service could have been better the main hall was very hot and humid dont know about other sitting areas they also have an outdoor sitting space
felt like pizza for the first time great ambience good service just everything you need
you will just love it here pizza perfect atmosphere perfect service perfect great place to hang out and click beautiful pictures
ive been a regular at fire ice and always enjoyed the food but today was very disappointing we saw cockroaches on two different tables right in front of the staff who reacted casually and didnt seem to care ive attached a video showing more cockroaches on the floor clearly a serious hygiene issue also the staff wasnt helpful or willing to make basic customizations to our food really hoping the management takes this seriously and improves both cleanliness and service
located within international club the original fire and ice has been brought in this beautiful setting with the same original taste
ive been coming to fire ice for many years and have always appreciated the food and overall experience unfortunately todays visit was extremely disappointing and raises serious hygiene concerns we saw three cockroaches on the table itself two on the first table we sat at and another on the second table we moved to both incidents happened right in front of the waiters yet the response was disturbingly casual one simply offered a quick apology and seemed completely unbothered as if this was nothing new im also attaching a video that shows cockroaches crawling on the restaurant floor which further highlights how unhygienic the environment has become this is completely unacceptable for a food establishment i sincerely hope the management takes this issue seriously and implements immediate pest control and sanitation measures on another note waiters over here too are not cooperative or emphatic while requesting for few modifications over pizza or any other food items
never order bolognese pasta here it tastes like really bad keema noodles with nepali tomato achaar and the pollo pizza literally tastes like roti with saltless potatoes as toppings and barely any chicken the service here is also really bad we had to ask for water and the pizza dressings despite being a pizzeria they didnt provide us anything to put on it we had to ask for it its worse than any restaurant ive been inthe only thing good about this place is that it is in the premises of international club thats about itcame here with high expectations and going with disappointment
as regulars in fire ice our recent experience at the jhamshikhel branch was not only disappointing but truly upsetting we ordered two pastas a carbonara and a pomodoro unfortunately both dishes were a letdown the carbonara contained pork that had an unpleasant almost spoiled smell and both pastas were extremely dry and lacked flavor this was completely unexpected given the standards fire ice is known for we sent the carbonara back and even after getting a new one it was still bad not like how it used to be however what followed was even worse being loyal fans of the nutella crepe with ice cream a dessert weve enjoyed countless times at fire ice thamel we were shocked when it arrived with melted ice cream that tasted sour and off clearly indicating it had gone bad we immediately raised the concern with the staff but instead of acknowledging the issue they insisted that the chef had tasted it and claimed it was fine we politely requested that they replace it without the ice cream they refused stating the kitchen was closed we then asked for a refund for the clearly inedible dessert but again they flatly refused with no effort to resolve the situation or offer any form of compensation despite explaining that we had just had the same dessert at the thamel outlet the day before which was excellent as always and clearly knew the difference the staff continued to be dismissive and unhelpful we hope the management takes this feedback seriously as customer loyalty should never be taken for granted
writing a review because the wait staff truly impressed me with their attentiveness after a heavy pizza id ordered a tiramisu for dessert which was delicious but was picking out most of the biscuit layer as i was full by that point and wanted to enjoy just the cream a waiter noticed and stopped to ask me if there was anything wrong with the tiramisu i told him no and that i was just full and that the tiramisu was indeed delicious but i was really impressed that he bothered to check in and make sure i was happy with my dessert i rarely come across such attentive service in kathmandu so this was a pleasant surprise plus the sanepa branch is just beautiful i really love the red walls and mosaic tiles
the staff and location are lovely but the pizza itself was mediocre especially for the hefty price ive had better in nepal
quality pizza and a good place to spend time conversing with friends a foreign staff even gave us some pizza to try for a new flavor their working on
last order last order last order last order sir last order this is what we were constantly heckled with as soon as we sat down a whole hour before closing time and a good half an hour before their actual last order time the staff here really need some training they act like they do not even want to serve you and would rather go home oh and they will also force feed you the bill and figuratively kick you out let the people eat in peace and enjoy their food and company ffs
the pizza is so mediocre they gave us scrambled eggs with spaghetti in the name of carbonara and when confronted said we make authentic carbonara with no cream so you will inevitably be served scrambled eggs for hospitality for food and for drinks
food average not so good not so bad atmosphere quite goodbut service worst their service is selective and depends on the bill amount of your table if youre in group or order more expensive foods youll be respected and treated with good service else if youre thinking of having one pizza and a dessert only then my friend dont even expect of being acknowledged that you exist
the pizza was amazing some of the best ive had in south asia the dough was cooked well and crispy bust still a little chewy
good food
the staff were too busy to serve us the food was nothing great or outstanding and even the temperature was not controlled some tables had no access to fans
being inside the international club its a pretty comfortable environment so that makes it a lot easier for this location to do well but the food and the service is on par with the original fire and ice and it tastes great
i must say the pasta was absolutely juicy and tasty the outdoor sitting under sun during cold weather was very memorable nice place to sit with friends and family
delicious food cozy atmosphere and excellent service the pizzas at fire and ice sanepa are authentic and full of flavor the staff were friendly and efficient and we were impressed by how smoothly everything ran with the help of their ims software highly recommend for a great dining experience
kathmandu is lucky to have the mediterranean gem
their bolognese is still as awesome as the one i had at their thamel branch back in
a must visit places in kathmandu

ive visited this place multiple times but with each visit the quality seems to decline the service isnt as good the atmosphere feels off and overall it just doesnt meet the expectations it once did the service isnt as attentive the atmosphere feels off and the overall experience just isnt what it used to be its disappointing to see the decline as it once had great potential i really hope they make improvements to bring back the quality that initially made this place enjoyable
ordered a carbonara and was thoroughly disappointed there was scrambled egg in it chef will know what went wrong the restaurant came highly recommend by locals
our hungry eyes always drag us to this famous pizza restaurant we love the pizzas and the hot chocolate it is always clean and in the heart of city the pizza is fully an italian style and is best served compared to any other fire ice pizzas are the best
ive only had pizza here and its good nothing special and its similar to other pizzas you can find in this price range the environment is bit noisy if you plan to sit inside but sitting outside watching the sunset having those slices of pizza is an amazing experience recommended
the interior decor really gives the italianish vibe to the restaurant the concept of the color of nepal flag as interior decor is so good i had ettore and al forno and both were just amazing
always great pizzas
pizza is very good but some people might find it bland the spaghetti and lasagna is to die for their service and ambience is unmatched good place to hangout catch up with friends family
ottime pizza e pasta veramente italiane il locale e molto bello e il servizio perfetto
good fresh food
very good place to have italian food
i went fire and ice located at sanepa and i impressed with there waiter name something like manab maharjan he is very cool and very gentleful person i loved his services i order salame pizza its was very delicious and service was soo fast thankyou fire and ice sanepa for your beautiful service
one of the best pizza available from ktm
love it will definitely go back
very good italian restaurant
lovely place wonderful atmosphere
love everything about this place
beautiful restaurant in the club they have seating indoor as well as outdoor service is quick pesto spaghetti was amazing the bruschetta was really good especially the olive one aglio olio spaghetti is not worth ordering even once the garlic oil is great all the vegetarian pizzas that we tried were great the variety of pizzas is insane the chocolate mousse and soft serve were great too tiramisu was good but ive had better the lemon iced tea was phenomenal definitely visit if youre in kathmandu
i had a fantastic experience the atmosphere was truly remarkable creating a welcoming and vibrant environment that enhanced our meal the pizza was delicious featuring a wellbalanced flavor and fresh ingredients what stood out the most was the exceptional customer serviceattentive friendly and genuinely caring overall it was a great dining experience and i highly recommend it for both the ambiance and the service
fire and ice is one of my go to pizza places and it has never disappointed me the panini that they serve is really good as well the ambience of this place is nice and has a garden space as well
used to be the best place to get italian food
there is a large garden nearby so it is a place where you can watch performances and the atmosphere is good i ate carbonara with eggs and i thought it was a healthy and fresh idea i was satisfied with both the taste and nutrition
best place for pizza and pasta as we all know from thamel outlet it is same here too safe option to choose to lunch or dine the quality of the food is always good
we went to the newly renovated international club for lunch ordered lamericana and ettore along with some chilled beer everything was okay nothing special the beer could have been better if served in a chilled glass
dont believe what the locals tell you go to pizza square instead fire and ice is a charmless restaurant with a mediocre understanding of pizza for example a calzone came with chunks of boiled egg when the egg should have been melted into the cheese and filling the chef clearly boiled and chopped an egg and slapped it onto the pizza en route to the oven the other pizzas were generally flavourless insipid even the staff were friendly in person but very rude when we rang them after the meal when one of us got very bad food poisoning runs to the toilet in hours before we even said what we ordered the stubbornly insisted it wasnt their fault i instead recommend pizza square in patan whose gourmet and affordable pizzas and excellent service will satisfy your appetites
pizza was crunchy and delicious
i am a huge lover of the nutela crepes in fire and ice usually today i had them and they barely put any nutela in the crepes the chocolate sauce whatever it was got stuck in my teeth furthermore the lady said they dont validate parking for deserts and drinks this seems a little too stingy in my opinion overall just a disappointing experience
i used to love pizzas from fire n ice thamel i tried the new spot in international club the pizza was very disappointingwe couldnt even finish it
chill place for pizza and pasta
most overrated restaurant waiters always look angry very bad customer service no air conditioning super average or sometimes below par food
i ordered the melanzane with pineapples and my friend ordered the ettore both were really good enough to last for lunch the next day which is always awesome very nice host and other staff members were kind as well not pictured but i also ordered the tiramisu which was the perfect size and really good would come back again outdoor seating is nice and the ambiance of the international club at night is very relaxing
pizzas
bad attitude of service person staff why we ordered pizza yards back side of pool they served in takeaway pack we decided move inside and enjoy those pizza suddenly one waiter came to us and said outside drinks is not allowed here we just order coffee at pool which was half of cup remain we replied ok from next time we will take care of this it was not our intention after one minute again other waiter came to us and said same things i think this is human and social understanding matter why they raised that drinks issues again and again while we are enjoying family time if you care that much why didnt u served pizza with plate and knife if it was not possible then why u didnt mention before take order make sure everything before sale your food our intention was not that your staff are too rude and less manner with customer i dont want to recommended this outlet anymore
not a bad
one of the finest pizza place in the town a neoclassic aesthetic place built around rana regime didnt find any napkins on the table but overall the food atmosphere parking were good
the best pizza in kathmandu in a beautiful garden and really good ice cream just next door
large and good pizza in sanepa
dear anna as a food enthusiast ive been enjoying pizzas at your lovely pizzeria for over two decades and im grateful for the consistent quality and service however i have a request for your international club patan branch please consider improving the air conditioning despite spending thousands of rupees on each visit its uncomfortable to sit near the limited aircoolers yet disheartening to see your hardworking staff including the waiters and the lady at the counter fanning themselves with bare hands against the high summer heat and work pressure adding a few ceiling fans and acs would greatly enhance the dining experience as well as healthier working environment for your staff both vital to the business thank you best regards a loyal customer
good food love the food there but no customer service it was hot as hell no fansno ac just coolers and the attitude of the waiters take it or leave i feel places like these should leave a benchmark for others to follow they dont respond to suggestions very disappointed today
good pizza
had a nice pizza there
service good
good ambience
hands down the best in nepal roadhouse and this place both seem to be on a tie for me but ambience wise this wins
good food and a very good ambience
i cant deny that the food at fire and ice is tasty but the quantity of ingredients used and the portion sizes has definitely decreased significantly at this spot unsure if its the same at the original location in thamel but it just seems that way here food is good environment is good service is a bit on the slower side parking available at the back
the pizza is great relying on foodmandu to deliver it is fn hopeless it took mins to deliver after it was picked up were mins away totally cold had to heat it in frypan hmm
always a great experience with the best pizzas
amazing experience here its worth every penny
this fire and ice is situated in a beautiful old palace grounds there is inside and outside seating arrangements the staff is friendly and well mannered we went for coffee and crepes it was delicious perfect to the point
a vintage old rana building complex built definitely in english colonial time lots of parking place playground for kids and last not least like awaited from this meanwhile an institution for italian cuisine very well done pizzas and pastas whereas the pasta would have been better if it was done al dante the service team needs to get briefings and couchings
this restaurant offers a great dining experience with delicious dishes and attentive service however we recommend avoiding the weekend rush as it can get very crowded and noisy
good authentic pizzas
our experience at the restaurant wasnt ideal we arrived at am and inquired about the closing time which we were told was we hurriedly placed our order only to learn that they would accept orders only until the staff began rearranging furniture at and making noise while we were still eating which disrupted our meal we felt that given the restaurants stated closing time of such activities could have been postponed until later despite our attempt to place another order at we were informed that no further orders would be accepted while we understand that the restaurant adheres strictly to its policies we expected more flexibility and better service especially considering the premium prices as guests we anticipated a higher level of hospitality and understanding of our needs
the choice to stay indoors or outdoors facing the lawn ups the atmosphere of this outlet of firice and makes it childfriendly too
the food and the pricing is very appealing had the soup and pizza and it was very delicious the place was packed on a tuesday evening seems to be very popular with the local crowd though i hear their other restaurant thamel location is supposedly even better the location where this restaurant is located is a heritage place so that adds to the charm of the experience
lovely place lovely food lovely staff cant wait to visit again
always a great place for pizza and their chips
food is good but not worth the price but if you consider the ambience and service maybe its worth it
located in the best place always here for the pizza and tiramisu
easily one of my favourite places in ktm for a good italian meal
the ambience is awesome the whole complex consists of a big gardenopen space huge parking area fire and ice pizzeria himalayan java coffee nenepal hand made artisan jewellery store silk icecream and many more the ambience is just wow with peaceful area with lots of open space for kids
good food good service amazing ambience with lots of parking
great food great atmosphere and great service
i have been going to the fire and ice location in thamel for two years i only recently discovered the lasagna polenta etc definitely recommend this dish if you crave a taste of home brought back good memories
beautiful atmosphere delicious pizza
it was the first time i visited fire and ice pizzeria the wait staff were quite active and quick the pizza we had was delicious the place is bigger with three different places the seating is comfortable and peaceful it also feels private good to visit with your friends family or a date
always a great place for pizza and lasagna taste is very consistent no matter how many times youve been there
wow pizza wow sandwich wow italian food just tastes like a wow so tasty so delicious and so creamy and mouth watering just wow wow wowwww
good food
excellent
amazing pizza
highly recommend very good food and atmosphere
food is good but service is a problem it is not able to handle a house full crowd
ordered a pesto pizza regina they brought us the pesto after we finished half of the pizza management does not care about customer feedback bad experience
fire and ice in sanepa international club no need to go to thamel for the people of lalitpur
had a positive experience at the thamel franchise previously i had high expectations but i was greatly disappointed by the taste of the carbonara the veg lasagna didnt quite satisfy me and it lacked the desired harmony between the sauce and vegetables the predominant taste was of spinach and zucchini ambiance the exterior had a cozy feel while the interior was of a familyoriented atmosphere service the service was reasonably prompt but i wasnit particularly impressed asked for water twice and didnt get it thamel fire and ice
the most overrated restaurant expensive without any taste pizza had no toppings pasta was bland ambiance was okish
they serve one of the best gourmet pizza in kathmandu i especially love their signature spicy rampopelli pizza the new branch in international club is just as good couldnt say enough do visit recommended
nice pizza nice place
fire and ice always has good pizzas
good for outing
pizza was dry and not as tasty as i thought for the price we pay we expect a higher standard
another example of focusing on ambience and ignoring the food quality i think the name should be ice and ice pizzeria as the staffs are so cold without a smile the owner should work on both food and service
the mansion is finally ready and what a beauty she is a conservation masterpiece with fine italian food buono et grazie
yummy pizza with good atmosphere
overall the food is only okay the pizzas in thamel outlet used to be much better than here the place has both indoor and outdoor seating good vibes greenery and a nice atmosphere i really wished the pizzas to be very good and they specialize in it spaghetti was a complete disappointment
the place is a wonderful location with gardens and a beautiful building shared space with other businesses we ordered hawaiiantunaquatro fromaggila marina best flavored pizza whole wheat crusts available on all pizza was a bonus most of which were not upto the fireice standards spaghetti lasagna and risotto were good seating arrangements could be made more comfortable but taking in mind that this is a new establishment there is much scope for improvements
it was a nice white house pizza experience
basic food ambience is good food
fire and ice serve premium pizzas i like the ambiance too
fire ice has always been the talk of the town when it came to pizzas but the new location really disappointed the place is nice but not convenient it was raining and parking was at a distance without any shade for protection against the rain the parking wasnt free either free for himalayan java but not for fire and ice the service was really bad with the staff banging the coke bottle on the table and not serving water until after the meal and after requesting it for multiple times they werent so busy either the pizza dough was and always is mindblowing however maybe unluckily the tomato sauce was not good at all and because of that most of the food we ordered turned out to be mediocre since all of them used the same tomatoes
so bad service that you feel unwelcomed no one smiles food wasnt good small table
beautiful new location the food is simply excellent
lovely place in the premises of international club sanepa ambience is very good had ettorechicken pizza cafe latte and a frappe and everything was very yumm service is really fast and i had a good time with my friend will visit again soon i would recommend this to friends and family
i was organizing my grandsons birthday dinner with some of my family members as always we were very pleased with the food drinks and everything my three grandchildren and the adults all enjoyed the evening
good place to take some beer and enjoy a nice pizza
you enter a beautiful garden amid historic welllit buildings menu and prices promise fine dining the glass of wine for nearly to rs arrives in a cheap and chunky glass that looks as if its off bhat bhatenis shelves no one will arrange your table no table mat cutlery rolled into a napkin is dumped on your table without a word the salami pizzas i had on two occasions were dry without any magic and with substandard salami from which emanated an unpleasant smell the food and service would be okay for an eatery but here you pay for fine dining really so this is a good place if you dont mind low standards and paying much for those
location wise nested within the international club in sanepa the best pizzaria in kathmandu has now a super apot in jhamel as well i had visited the parent hub in thamel a day ago which is still the best of two sanepa will give it a run for the money considering its location in sanepa l while the waiter just brought me when i had ordered two i didnt mind waiting as the outside sesting are is just next to the common garden overall give it a try and let me know
really good atmosphere and really great place for a date good pizza as expected and dont order the appetizer in my photo really not worth it would visit again with friends family or a date
raw veggies in pizza flavorless and tasteless
i ate pizza pollo tomato sauce mozzarella sweet corn chicken potatpotatoes rosemary and penne al forno both are delicious i want to eat again and again
superb location
hot insideouter tabel are quite small and raining problem
new and a more scenic place but same old ambiance and taste
very slow service
authentic italian pizza and food really wanted to cone tonlalitpur area and at last they have if you love fire and ice at thamel this is much better and spacious food is stars plenty of parking space at the international club highly recommended
although somewhat pizza is expensive compare to other places in lalitpur the pizza and pasta were awesomeserving took delayed but good vibes if live musice is introduced this will be one of best places in lalitpur
staff seemed rude and judgmental body language gave it away
excited for the new location food seems the same as the one in thamel which i appreciate lovely atmosphere and will only get better as they continue to add more to the complex so fun
delightful experience having lunch here the layout of the place is spacious and the location is super the food and service is excellent the staff is very well trained and are very courteous
worst restaurant staff security
found the pizza here quite average than what i had tasted in fire and ice pizzeria thamel that might be due to my high expectations that the pizza would burst my tastebud it was average nothing new and simple
although pricy this is the best pizzeria in kathmandu and now they have a branch in sanepa first of all ample parking space in the international club complex i love the ambience this new place is designed meticulously to give you the italian feel i have no complaints of the food here and they also have their signature softeys here too very friendly staff clean bathrooms a lot of seating space indoors outdoors and also a small cafe overlooking the swimming pool
beautiful place with equally wonderful food ambiance and people
even here times in a week quite a few good menu choices tried three kinds of gnocchi burger pizza all great
one of the best pizzeria in kathmandu must go place if you like italian food the calzone is one of the best that i like in this place they serve good dessert also this new outlet in lalitpur has plenty of parking the ambience is good as well staffs are very polite and attentive id definitely advise this place if you love pizza or italian food
another great pizzeria in sanepa area at the remodeled international club great location good vibe amazing pizzas tip to management add draught beer
i had an amazing experience at bhojan griha kathmandu the heritage setting is beautiful the staff are warm and welcoming and the traditional nepali thali was delicious and filling the live folk music and cultural dance performances made the evening even more special definitely a mustvisit for anyone who wants to enjoy authentic nepali food with a cultural touch
good food with best service most expensive for normal people
very nice place combination of nepali and modern service
honestly a tourist trap but a good one priced at usd for dinner including a rice wine lots of dances from different areas which is fun and the diners joined in food was fine not the best but given the atmosphere it was worth it
really enjoy the dancing the food was really good
authentic nepali feels at a price of course but great place for dinner with family phenomenal cultural dance performances varieties of food options better than any thakali place ive been to before experience the timeless palace interiors with authentic nepali food and cultural dance
the starter included badam sadheko bhuteko makai garnished peanuts pot baked corn aloo tareko potatoes fried nepali styled momocha meat filled dumplings soup veg soup kwatti ko surwa mixed vegetable soup main course sada bhuja steamed white rice jhaneko mas ko dal split black dal flavored with jimmu khashi ko masu mutton kukhura ko mashu chicken curry sweets sikarni sweetened yogurt cream so in total per person it was rs if you arrive on time like from pm onwards theres dance cultural shows as well plus theres painting of kings which is simply wow
its a rip off their website shows something they get menu with usd for each even a year old child was charged same price as you all know kids usually dont eat much for the restaurant we reached early did not know the music time we were there only for music only food we could have eaten anywhere but the attitude the musician showed was very bad if someone offers some tips you dont accept it thats alright but never make fun of what you offered make public to show us down we paid npr rupees for dinner non vegetarian thali even they charged npr for a sprite that was totally rip off on foreigners who visit nepal apart from that people who were serving were laughing as i asked times mutton to serve this was too much i dont recommend this plan to anyone they think we are sheep who voluntarily came to them to get slaughtered i literally told on their faces while paying the bill they asked sorry but cant heal what they did to me coming to food they dont have anything else apart from aloo fry dal momo mini dry chicken greens mushroom pickle rice with mutton curry this is their menu items i paid npr rupees for dinner non vegetarian thali can you imagine i know i was scape goat now laugh at me it make sense
the manager cant handle the food critic and dont know anything about the customer service very unprofessional dont even have the the bottle water available
the menu isnt suitable for kids and theres no wheelchair access the fixed menu offered no choices and the water quality wasnt great there were no options to purchase bottled mineral water and when we brought our own the manager was rude and dismissive of our feedback while the cultural show was a nice effort more variety and options for kids and international guests would enhance the experience specially for the price paid
great place for authentic nepali cuisine in a palace years old
would not recommend evidently they dont have anything on the menu that is shown on their website we ended up paying usd each for a fixed price menu with low quality food that we didnt want i dont know if this is just for americans but it felt like we were getting swindled
this review may only be applicable to foreigners there is an excellent and varied menu on the website it is not available to foreigners we asked about it and we were told we could only have one menu quoted in us dollars which is always strange attached here interesting the locals at the table next to us had a totally different menu and food than we did foreigners are not allowed to order what they were ordering apparently the meat was much tougher than expected service was fairly flat there are no signs so you have to walk through the building and somebody was holding a speech or religious service and you have to walk through it for a price that is extremely high in nepal especially given the lack of choice available to foreigners relative to what is advertised on the site it was a very bad deal note we were here for lunch i understand there may be some evening music and entertainment and this review only applies to lunch
food awesome service awesome and ambiance awesomehighly recommended
food was not good undercooked food specially non veg items not a good place considering the price they charge enjoy your evening in thamel instead
amazing cultural experience and fantastic food
good place
great place to have dinner with your family and enjoy cultural dance
nice
everything was so great from food ambience and services would visit definitely agin when i will be back to
while visiting kathmandu this place is such a special place to visit experience nepalese food dancers music clothes from various districts of the country a cultural tour of nepal at a beautiful historical building delicious food
wunderbar mit tanz u musik in tollem ambiente
the atmosphere was warm the tables were set low with the seats it was a different experience but enjoyable food was served along side with the cultural performance its a wonderful experience thankful to our host who brought us here
what an absolutely amazing experience absolute pleasure to have experienced such culture and amazing customer service highly highly recommend
good food good dance show
the place is absolutely is a amazing place with historic buildings and cultural dance with great food i have taken my travelers for the dinnerthey enjoy the atmosphere and cultural dance of nepal its a best place to have the dinner in kathamndu
i like the services and food here with the live performace the dance was also good the people are humble and the food was tasty
a place that is perfect to experience the taste of nepal the food served here is an experience that showcases the traditional dining of nepal with live traditional dance and music to go with slightly expensive but definitely worth it you teuly wont regret dining here in addition the building where this establishment is located happens to be a historical one where teh bada gurju of the then rana rulers lived
price was too much expensive and quantity was so little the main thing was there was no option to choose which food to eat the only item in the menu was thali set with some side dishes and we should take it one by one per person really bad experience
worth it
the vibe was so good and ambiance also
beautiful place to spend a night with loved ones
the dancing the mutton the service and atmosphere were wonderful i loved the opportunity to try some wonderful nepali food while watching great dancing performances an absolute pleasure all around
i wish i could give more than stars particularly for the atmosphere the food was lovely and the staff really helpful explaining what the dishes were the music and dancers just made a great experience that much more special loved the yoghurt too
i had a farewell dinner here after a four week journey in south asia what a wonderful place and unique atmosphere lovely food
wonderful newari cultural experience beautiful atmosphere excellent food accompanied by stunning cultural dance and music performances this is one of my favorite place to bring guests from countriesi
the atmosphere is great but food quality and service standards have fallen in the recent years food was served cold and looks like the servers are not trained from a hospitality school
vinimos por la boda de un amigo y muy buen sitio tradicional
amazing place to visit with family and friendsthe hospitality was really good and impressivethe staffs were really welcomingits a must visit to explore nepali culture and food
a must visit place to experience the rich culture of nepal the place where food meets culture live performances and great ambiance
quite ambience and great food with cultural night
our nepalese culture dance and food vojan very goodi felt
they had prepared us halal meal upon our request we were a big group tho this is the most appreciated thing for a muslim struggling to find a halal place in kathmandu the nepali food here was the best compared to the other places weve eaten the staff is very friendly the atmosphere is so warm there are sitting areas with or without traditional dance show so you can choose friendly advice to wear nice socks if youre going there
i was really looking forward to my visit to bhojan griha especially since they market themselves as a place that combines nepali performance with food unfortunately both aspects fell flat the performance felt weak overall while there were a few moments where the performers genuinely seemed to enjoy themselves most of the time it was bland and lacked energy i expected a vibrant display of culture but it just didnt deliver as for the food it was nothing to write home aboutquite ordinary for the price point i was hoping for something special to complement the performance but it really missed the mark additionally the service was rushed and made it hard to engage with the staff it felt like they were more focused on turning tables than providing a good dining experience overall i left feeling disappointed bhojan griha has potential but they really need to step up both their performances and their food to match the expectations they set
overly priced restaurant where normal nepalese or a traveller on budget cant afford i would not recommend this restaurant to a budget traveller unless you are a highly paid diplomat unless you are cash rich tourist or a bigshot nepali food portions served less service staffs focused on selling the buffet menu only food tasted normal only the good part is cultural performance and the heritage house otherwise its just a overhyped restaurant
very good
had a wonderful time while i went there price is reasonable service is good
nestled in the heart of kathmandu bhojan griha offers a unique dining experience that beautifully blends tradition culture and authentic nepali cuisine housed in a yearold heritage building the restaurants rustic charm transports guests back in time making for a warm and immersive atmosphere
great ambiance and good food
perfect
a dazzling disappointment bhojan grija impresses with its inviting ambience and elegant silverware creating a warm atmosphere for diners however the food disappoints lacking depth of flavor and creativity despite its artistic presentation after waiting hours for the main courses the experience feels particularly sloppy while the attentive service adds warmth it cannot compensate for the mediocrity of the culinary offerings the saving grace is the vibrant cultural performances that entertain throughout the evening ultimately bhojan grija is a beautifully set table where the experience is more about culture than foodcome for the performances not the cuisine
turned out to be best in authentic nepali dance
wow such a wonderful events i love the environment hospitality outstanding heads up
everything was exceptional traditional food and service were excellent and atmosphere with traditional dance performances was outstanding it is a great place
not worth the dinner as i expected expectationvsreality
line hotel service at night on the way journey to ktm
very tasty food cultural dances and good atmosphere thank you barat basnet
amazing experience with my family

bhojan griha delivers an authentic taste of nepal with a menu that expertly showcases the rich culinary traditions of the himalayas from the delicate momos to the hearty dal bhat every dish is crafted with impeccable care transporting diners to the heart of nepali culture in an elegantly appointed setting
great place to experience our nepali culture the course dining was good and the cultural performances was plesently entertaining the total experience was really wholesome hope to come here again soon
no se lo recomiendo a nadie aunque le encante el folclore nepali la comida realmente mala el baile no voy a entrar a valorarlo y el senor que bueno que es increible que en el siglo se hagan estas cosas nos llevo un tour operador local
the palacelike ambiance and royal service made us feel like true royalty the authentic nepali cuisine was exquisite with each dish bursting with traditional flavors the mesmerizing music and dance performance added to the enchantment from the moment we arrived the impeccable hospitality and enchanting decor made our visit truly special highly recommended for a regal dining experience
our culture is our pride and bhojan griha try to keep by themselves for us thank you so much for such beautiful concept this place is really suit to entire family members belonging from nepal and as well tourists from outside of nepal to show our culture as well as our typical foods
all things are nice over here if you are going have a dinner enjoy it slowly you will feel better
the food was terrible and to make matters worse we found hair in our saag it was unnecessarily costly too and the dishes didnt have much authentic taste extremely disappointed
nice place for a group cultural dance rs approx per person go there for experience
it was an amazing experience to be there i was there with my family perfect for family gathering the food and hospitality was very good me and my family enjoyed it throughly will visit again soon
what used to be a good restaurant has dropped in food quality and service this was the th time we have been to this restaurant albeit our first time since before covid the quality of food dramatically dropped bland thali food that was barely warm untrained service staff and a high price tag for the foodexperience servers were rude and nonattentive we recommend checking out other restaurants in kathmandu
most disappointing dining experience in kathmandu we looked forward to enjoying the advertised entertainment and meal package with our guests who were visiting nepal for the first time however our evening took a sour turn when a group affiliated with the tourism association also dining there monopolized the use and enjoyment of the restaurant the prolonged speeches at their table delayed the entertainment causing an hourlong disruption despite our pm reservation efforts to address the situation with senior management were futile as our concerns were dismissed even when the musicians attempted to commence the performance they were abruptly silenced by members of the tourism association the tourism associations behavior displayed a profound lack of respect and an attitude of selfimportance pressuring other diners to conform to their unreasonable demands witnessing such a disregard for hospitality and basic respect was embarrassing particularly ironic given their meetings supposed purpose of promoting tourism regrettably the restaurants management failed to rectify the situation choosing instead to cater to the tourism associations selfish demands this lack of responsiveness was deeply disappointing the few appetizers that did arrive after long drawn out pauses were subpar i cannot speak for the main course as our dinner was cut short due to the selfish demands of the tourism association members without the entertainment aspect the food is definitely not worth the price tag in conclusion i would advise patrons to consider supporting other local establishments that uphold the standards of hospitality and professionalism bhojan griha is not an accurate representation of the wonderful nepalese culture cuisine and hospitality
worst dining experience in kathmandu poor management staff overpriced subpar nepali food and bait and switch no dancemusic we were so excited to have a traditional and cultural nepali experience since we were visiting from new york we prebooked this restaurant so we could see nepali dancing and music after driving hour through peak traffic for our pm reservation we come to realize that the restaurant management had seated us in a room where the tourism association was having a business meeting with members the dancemusic show was supposed to promptly start at pm however when the entertainers came on the tourism association members insisted the entertainers not perform we expressed our dismay with the staff and senior management team they failed to make any attempt to remediate the situation i spoke with senior management members and all they could say was sorry this whole situation could have easily been avoided if the management had put the tourisim association in a private room or sat us in a separate room to begin with a restaurant we had high hopes for was beyond disappointing please note that this restaurant is expensive by kathmandu standards save your money and support a local restaurant that actually appreciates and values its customers the courses we tried before leaving bhojan griha midway through were lackluster the momos were dry the popcorn was bland and lthe soup was lukewarm the lack of respect they had for their customers was appalling the irony of it all was that the tourism association bullied the tourists into leaving the restaurant and ruined our tourism experience of kathmandu
best fine dining restaurant with live cultural performances and traditional ambiance feels like star traditional restaurant in town
bhojan griha is situated within a lavish palace exuding an aura of luxury and grandeur reminiscent of a mythical and cultural treasure trove stepping into the theatrical hall guests are greeted with gentle murmurs from the courtyard setting the tone for a sophisticated dining experience the staff warmly welcomes patrons with delicate gestures adding to the anticipation of what lies ahead the highlight of the evening is the mesmerizing display of cultural dances and songs adding a unique charm to the dining affair the culinary offerings are equally delightful inviting guests to savor each dish with joy the impeccable service of the staff enhances the overall dining experience leaving a lasting impression of remarkable hospitality the restaurant owner personally engages with guests ensuring a familial atmosphere where everyone feels valued and cherished spending approximately two hours in this enchanting environment feels akin to losing oneself in a cultural village both foreign and local tourists seeking an unparalleled culinary and cultural experience the restaurant may seem pricey at first but the value offered in terms of service unlimited food and cultural entertainment surpasses any initial cost concerns its truly an exceptional package deal leaving patrons longing to return for more thank you
i recently dined at bhojan griha and regrettably my experience was far from pleasant despite the steep price of the thali set which costs around equivalent to rs the quality of the food was profoundly disappointing firstly the taste of the food was abysmal each dish in the thali set was either bland overly salty or lacked freshness for such a high price one would expect a wellprepared and flavorful meal but this was certainly not the case the overall quality of the food left much to be desired secondly the service was incredibly poor when ordering the thali set one would expect all items to be served together allowing for a cohesive dining experience instead each staff member brought out only one item at a time this disjointed service meant that by the time i received the final item of my thali set i had already finished the rest of the meal this not only disrupted the dining experience but also showed a lack of coordination and efficiency among the staff on a more positive note the restaurant does offer a cultural dance performance which adds a lively and entertaining atmosphere to the dining experience the ambiance is enjoyable and if you are interested in the cultural performances it might be worth a visit just for that however it is evident that bhojan griha primarily caters to foreign tourists the focus on ambiance over food quality and service is apparent if you are looking for an authentic and satisfying dining experience i would recommend looking elsewhere in summary while the cultural dance and atmosphere are commendable the poor food quality and disjointed service at bhojan griha make it a place i would not recommend for a meal save your money and dine at a restaurant that prioritizes both taste and service
the food was amazing we had a few traditional nepalese food in other restaurantsbut this was another leve the food was great the place is original and well maintained my wife and i had a great night and extraordinary experience highly recommend also the dessert was out this world
the experience was good and deliting
excellent food and service very nice show with music and local dancing recommended
few things off about the place the owner one manager maybe and a bartender these three people i have never seen smiling or welcoming other staffs are great and very welcoming except the three individuals
nice place and best services
bhojan griha in dillibazar offers a mesmerizing journey through nepali culture and cuisine from the moment you step in the impeccable service sets the tone for a memorable dining experience the enchanting cultural dances transport you to the heart of nepals rich traditions what truly sets bhojan griha apart is the personal touch one of the staff members and even the owner took the time to showcase the intricate paintings and share fascinating details about the place its not just a meal its an immersive cultural adventure highly recommended for anyone seeking authenticity and hospitality in the heart of kathmandu
what a wonderful evening incredible food such attentive serving and the most beautiful nepali entertainment thank you so much next time were in kathmandu we will return
loved the ambience waiters were too occupied due to which they were in rush while serving trust me nepali cuisine is far tasty than what they are serving please improvise your food
this is the ultimate nepalese traditional dining experience housed in an old traditional nepalese building the restaurant offers traditional thali accompanied with alcohol music and dance the place is on the expensive side but truly value for money the food is tasty clean and flavorful at the same time and the plate be replenished till your hunger pangs are satisfied the staff is extremely polite and efficient the owner of the restaurant will come and talk to you while you dine to make it a more personalized experience i highly enjoyed the music and dance as well definitely will go back to this place in my next visit to kathmandu given the demand it is recommended to have an advance booking
good ambience mouthwatering nepali delicacies along with cultural dance from various ethnic groups of nepal on heart of kathmandu with historical significance
for an unparalleled nepali culinary adventure combined with mesmerizing cultural performances look no further discover the rich history within these walls and uncover their fascinating stories
a traditional nepali restaurant with traditional food dances and music
environment is nice specially the different nepali danceslot can be improved in menu menu was completely unsatisfactorymenu needs to be really managed
the food was average the rice was not properly cooked will not recommend to waste time and money at this place
it is a very special experience i definitely recommend to go there if you want to see sink into the traditions of nepal
i love how one can experience the nepali culture here the service and atmosphere was amazing friendly staff i would go back again
the service ambience and food were amazing best dinner we had in kathmandu the live music and dance between courses was very enjoyable
we went as a group of four based on a google search that turned up this restaurant as a promising candidate for nepalese cuisine the online menus we found seemed good and so we agreed to meet up for dinner we found a restaurant owned by a passionate foodie and advocate for nepali culture there was a prix fixe menu that included several appetizers soup mains rice wine and dessert in addition to a drinks menu we were offered vegetarian substitutes for the two meat dishes chicken curry and a mutton curry if desired there was also a band playing nepali instruments along with dancers highlighting local dances from different regions as the final dance was winding down we were offered coffee or masala tea we came for dinner and were treated to an excellent meal and much more they recently reopened after being closed for a while and were glad we found them worth an evening when youre in kathmandu
great food great hospitality
kathmandu visit for me is always food and sight seeing a place for me to relax this city has the history history of the country kings culture and many more this time i was fortunate to visit this amazing place bhojan griha if i translate word by word it is bhojan meal griha homehouse the restaurant used to be a palace once upon a time so you are ideally in a royal palace enjoying a royal meal in a royal way shaahiiandaaj the meal served and the way it is served is royal you have to experience it to feel it it is for sure a must to visit try while you enjoy your meal you will enjoy the live music a group of talented artists playing the traditional nepali musical instruments many traditional dances are performed the food is served in bronze plates bowls which is a traditional way of serving in nepal travel explore food nepali culture tradition royal palace

amazing cultural experience little nuggets of nepali different groups with dances from sherpa to tharu culture food is typical nepali food the atmosphere is clean tidy neat with cultural touches loved it
fun place with traditional food and dance
ambience is quite good the nepali cultural show is quite a good one but the food is not at par with normal thakali restaurant in town i felt the due to excess use of spices the food tastes numb also the single thali cost which is quite an expensive in nepal and little improvement in service time given the premium amount paid is necessary
best food nice ambience best place for family one time off course we have to come here
great authentic nepal food and traditional dance performance
delay service

dining with live music and dance had an wonderful experience overall authentic and organic nepali food tasted like homemade with love having less spices the cultural dance added more enjoyment to the dining highly recommended
erg lekker eten een super leuke ervaring met traditioneel nepalees eten muziek en dans zeker een aanrader
venue un peu par hasard jai trouve des gens sympathiques et serieux une cuisine pleine de gout et soignee et une intervention musicale traditionnelle avec un ensemble de danseurs et de musicienschanteurs le prix est acceptable aux vues de la prestation je recommande au moins une fois en venant a katmandou
amazing food like a good homestyle country savory dinner with fine dining
amazing cultural experience highly recommend
it provides an authentic nepalese experience so i recommend to friends from abroad for nepalese itself prices are on the expensive side and food is what we eat daily so for experience it would be fine for foreigners to know nepalese culture in a summary this will be a good place to start with
best ambience and great food perfect to taste real newari food very hospitable people want to go again
it was an excellent experience and great hospitality in a beautiful building the food was amazing their phylosophy was reflected in every dish a must to visit in kathmandu

i loved bhojan griha and highly recommend this special restaurant i wanted to try something authentically nepalese and was in for a major surprise bharat basmet the manager has transformed one of the royal properties into this fantastically charming restaurant want to be treated to an authentic royal dining experience then this is the place to go i had three waiters complete with nepalese traditional costumes serve me a multicourse meal spiced potatoes chicken momo dumplings bean soup meat dal rice diverse small servings of deliciously seasoned vegetables desert drink and coffee the usd i paid was worth every penny i was told that i ought to have come after pm in order to experience nepalese cultural performances thank you mr basmet for a unique and memorable experience in kathmandu
if youre looking for authentic nepali food folk music and dance than this is the place visited this place with my friend who is vegetarian and we both loved the food nepali rice wine is must and you can refill n number of times
overall is okay for amazing experience of nepalese food
dance live music and food was great enjoyed our time i only wish the owner wouldnt have stood next to us and pressuring us to leave a comment it did creep us out a bit
one of the oldest restaurants in nepal with authentic local food and nice ambience
authentic nepali food and atmosphere at an excellent price

best nepali restauran in town
this place is a time travel it is like going to an early th century building to have the most authentic nepali food while the music and dances go on simultaneously let me tal about few good things good pre historic ambiance cultural dances authentic nepali food of rice lentils the server was very hospitable the nice gesture of putting blessing on forehead at the entry some suggested improvement only one service attendant serving high pricepoint this place is a very good place for family dinners dinners for foreign guest however i advise you to check your pocket before you go to this place nevertheless for the service venue the experience the price as well is set right
loved it

great traditional nepalese food and experience is definitely worth a visit
ha sido increible venir recomendados a este restaurante nepali de comida tradicional es toda una experiencia con musica y baile en vivo y un menu degustacion delicioso sin duda recomiendo a la gente amante de descubrir restaurantes que se apunten a este para conocer mas de la cultura nepali
its a totally different experience the monent you enter the place youll feel like you are in a different time the place the building architecture the way they serve and the way they entertain us are unique its worth it going to this place once in a while food is not extraordinary so stars but you should visit this place since its not just about the food but about the whole new experience
a unique place for traditional lunch dinner and events
i visited bhojan griha on rd july based on the rating of the place this review is therefore a review on what to expect if you visit the place i was escorted from the gate to the steps that take you up the restaurant which kind of felt nice the setting upstairs was decent and the large open window meant that there was decent fresh cool air circulation i was asked to take off my shoes and followed the waiter water was served in brass glass and i knew it was going to be a traditional meal i washed my hands in a small mens room and the small washbasin was also made of brass outside there was a short veranda which lead to another room where one person was sitting on a duvet on the floor and giving an interview if you were to have lunch in that setting you would be sitting on the floor i was in the adjoining room where the chairs were low and so were the tables but i was not sitting on the floor the water came and gave me a set menu which at usd appeared high to me in any case i asked for the ala carte and wasnt disappointed as he reluctantly even if politely produced the menu card i ordered mixed vegetables and dal along with two chapati i also ordered a fanta the food when it came was once again served in brass ware and was fresh the fanta was served in a glass and was without fizz probably they use large bottles to save costs but this is not a cheap place so the saving is in poor taste because when you pay more you notice the descrepancies more the food tastes good and was freshly made no one asked to switch on the table fans and i just ignored the minor amiss here the waiter appeared just as i was finishing and asked if there would be anything else i requested for the bill the bill when it came struck me as slightly odd there was a service charge but the waiter was in any case hanging around waiting for more the vat was on both the basic bill and the service charge which was a bit odd i left some small tip not to disappoint the poor man who probably doesnt even get the service charge the bill was over usd which is clearly a lot for normal nepalese cuisine even if in a decent setting i am going with star
good environment
access is difficult
too bad service
it would be a lot better if we could atleast choose a menu one set of courses is just not done not to mention the price is expensive as hell
best place to enjoy nepal cultural dance and music with nepalese food
very nice environment good food and entertainment
amazing
the dinner is a set menu and we found the food to be just average they have traditional nepali folk dances till pm which was an attraction at npr per person we also did not find value for money spent the menu specified rates usd plus service charge per person rates mentioned only in usd
such a great place loved it
thanks again i was just the same
one of the most warm and welcoming places in kathmandu its a must visit place with delightful and ethnic nepali cuisine god bless them all
great food with rich in culture and traditions from food to service must visit very entertaining along with a food trail
great place we had big family group probably around people but the accommodation was great the cultural event was something i enjoyed so much they served snacks and dinner with cultural event in between so you can plan or long event i liked the food as well including the main nepali khana it tries very neatly to highlight the historical and cultural aspect of nepal would recommend anyone going with their foreign friends and family for this event
well but much expensive
serves typical nepali food really liked the taste of the food with which i was served recommend
overhyped food is very average service is good
amazing local food and entertainment
good food fun entertainment
go and get the new experience
el espectaculo muy corto la comida no esta mal pero el precio es abusivo ademas el local esta perdido
good food but somewhat dear i think its worth it at the end
nice plae for pure nepali food
food quality was good but overall a bit expensive the cultural program was good but there is ample scope for improvement
good for authentic nepali food
nice experience trying local nepali food and dance
this place is so historic and gives a bit of some royal vibes also the khana is pretty delicious here
nice place
really beautiful nepali dancing and music its pricey at usd per person but worth it for the good food and dinner show good wine too
excellent place for authentic nepalese food with dance
ancient place of juddga ssmshera jbr
good place for eating
overpriced and overlyhyped the staff is only offering the expensive set other ala carte is not available i guess they only want us to eat the expensive food the place is not as described will not recommend might as well go to other more local place for better taste and definitely better for the pocket well the building is instagram worthy but maybe need some maintenance
offers custom menu good for groups high end place
overpriced restaurant per person when you can have much better food for anywhere else or even in the street the food was ok not fantastic not horrible the dances where entertaining but ibwojld still not recommend the place
excesivamente caro y la comida deja mucho que desear
this is one of the best neplease food items restaurant quality food is offered in reasonable price all types of neplease foods are available here a lot of foreign people come here to taste neplease quality foods price is little higher good furnishing calm environment plz visit this at once
tres bien
and it was an amazing experience loved the expression of traditionality infused with the cultural perks over all a must place to be cosy and simply enjoy nepal

tipical nepali place to hang out especially for foreign people and also can enjoy different nepali cultural dance program with best nepali cusine
nice nepalies resturent
its is a traditional restaurant great for family time and meet ups with the facility of entertainment
like no other place
great place for a nepali style dinner along with awesome diverse cultural performances throughout your meal make sure you reach around pm to catch all the performances
just nice but need to know your style of seating because if you are there for the first time you might not feel the comfort in seating but in fairness they have so many seating options i believe this is best among several nepali restaurants in kathmandu that feature cultural dances and original nepalese food i enjoyed the place the food the performance and above all i had a good company a night to remember
good authentic nepalese food and entertainment
a great experience with full of nepali traditional food music and dance a bit expensive side byt its worth for a change highly recommended with prior booking as most of the time its pack with foreigners
traditional local food beautiful building excellent service nice folk music and dance
lovely food and awesome service
too pricey for the average food dont try daal bhat on this place
very nice place for food for tourists very interesting atmosphere great menu and service a bit overpriced for a menu per person which is a looot for nepal also they are very ecofriendly no single use plastic
great experience very authentic and classic
no words
amazing place to experience the traditional nepali food and dance performances
nice place and atmosphere
been with my sister in law and brother and rest of my family recently on the occasions of dashain the owner himself was very humble to us a man down to earth its not i have been there very st time but the environment and freshness always tends to be st time the cultural dance ethical value of our country oh wow wht more i could say what a staffs love it recommended
outstanding nepali venue with traditional nepali food served through different courses friendly staff and musical features throughout the night loved it
nice place but overpriced for set menu dinner and few minutes of cultural dance
typical nepali cultural hotel in the heart of kathmandu its an old house built years ago
a tourist place for nepali food with cultural dance
good to feel the traditional nepal
very nice place and very nice dining
really overrated dont go there if youre looking for italian pizza
barely any tomato sauce on the pizza unlucky for the price of the pizza i am really disapointed i wouldnt recommend this place for true pizza lovers
i always aim to visit the roadhouse cafe and stay at the roadhouse hotelwhen im in kathmandu excellent service wholesome and nteresting menu
saroj and astha were really good with their service

good pizza
good italian food in center of thamel
nice place for pizza and pastas
having visited roadhouse cafe on several occasions i can confidently say it remains one of the most consistent and reliable dining spots in thamel while the menu offers a variety of options the standout dish for me has always been the fish and chips freshly prepared perfectly crispy and full of flavor its a simple dish done exceptionally well in addition to that their pizza is a crowd favorite and continues to be one of their bestsellers with a thin woodfired crust and generous toppings its ideal for sharing or enjoying solo the ambiance is cozy with a relaxed vibe making it a great place to unwind whether youre a local or a traveler if you find yourself in or around thamel roadhouse cafe is highly recommended for a satisfying meal and pleasant dining experience
i am a big fan of roadhouse cafe food wherever i go either in ktm or pkr thank you for such an wonderful menu
really nice place with a very nice staff
best pasta in nepal for sure btw just try the special one its good
great as always a classic in thamel with amazing pizzas saroj the waiter was very helpful the whole time great personnel and i recommend the sizeling fudge
nice food nice place and thank you saroj
tucked in the heart of thamel this boutique cafe served up the best pizza and yummiest dessert for a cozy romantic dinner date in kathmandu
had the salmon waffle benedict and ive got to say its definitely interesting waffle was a little heavy but its definitely something you can push aside and eat after for dessert ill have to come back for the pizza nice place and great service

pytsh mvlh yqr
ambiente super acolhedor e com aquele charme que so se encontra nos bons cafes de viagem pedi uma pizza e honestamente superou as expectativas massa fina bem estaladica e ingredientes frescos a serio o staff foi simpatico e atento e o espaco e perfeito para uma pausa tranquila no meio da confusao de katmandu recomendo a principalmente para quem anda a procura de um bocadinho de italia no nepal
had to wait more than mins the order to be taken the waiter is not very polite
tried the spicy tuna pizza at roadhouse cafe for the first time and i must say it completely exceeded my expectations roadhouse is already known for its great pizzas but this one turned out even better than the classic chicken pizza the flavors were perfectly balanced with just the right kick of spice the space was comfortable and the overall ambience was really nice great for catching up with friends or just enjoying a good meal however one thing i felt could be improved is the water service it would be more welcoming if they offered regular drinking water as a basic courtesy currently they only serve mineral water if you order it which feels a bit off for an otherwise great dining experience overall a fantastic visit with delicious food just hoping for a little more hospitality when it comes to water service
exceptional pizza we totally recommend the roadhouse blues one also the one with chicken was really good a totally unexpected find especially in nepal very nice place you can pay by card we went two times thats how good the pizza was
we came here after looking at the reviews ambience is nice so are staffs we both ordered one pan grill breakfast and masala tea was expecting a hot breakfast but everything was cold apart from just the hash brown i didnt understand the concept of them using the hot plate which was not even hot it didnt taste as good as we had expected we have eaten way better breakfast of this kind at other places at a reasonable price but on the lighter note the masala tea was the only plus point
takiego sniadanka w kathmandu nie moglismy sobie nawet wymarzyc brakuje musztardy ale czy w nepalu w ogole ja maja

kaushala got our custom pizza order exactly the way we wanted and delivered it hot and crispy she served the food with a wonderful smile
incredible pizza in the heart of thamel you wont find anywhere better if you need to scratch that italian food itch
lekker als je een keer wat anders wilt eten dan nepalees voedsel het is wat aan de dure kant en het personeel heeft wat moeite met grote drukte als je hier gaat lunchen is het prima
great food pizza and the chicken tortia were amazing price are a little bit more than other restaurants in the tamel but it was worth it we also staying in the hotel so we enjoy both
ich war sehr positiv uberrascht das essen war sehr gut die pizzas sind super lecker und das personal sehr hoflich und zuvorkommend gemutliches ambiente

ambiance brilliant but the food is what i absolutely disliked pasta lacked flavour and wasnt cooked had to send it back to make sure they cook it came back the same uncooked
delicious wood fire pizza thamel
magnifico sitio pizza excelente volveremos a repetir
nothing on the menu wasnt nice we ate here several times over our stay in kathmandu it was lovely we ate both breakfast lunch and dinner there
best place best food in town
quality place in kathmandu stayed in roadhouse hotel and they served the breakfast few but high quality options also feel guilty but i ate a pizza here instead of momos woodfired pizza was tasty
staff sometimes get the order wrong but mostly good place is too dark to read the menus
serve good pizza and pork chop
is een goed italiaans restaurant
i came here with students from the usa for pizza and we had a wonderful time we ordered the chicken pizza for everyone and it was delicious great crust and great flavor
dong xi hao chi jia ge shao gui dan huan he li tui jianyuan yi zai ci hui fang
good quality food we ordered roadhouse nacho cheezy jalapeno ball chicken supreme pizza fish and chips virgins mojito french hot chocolate and oreo milk shake value for money bit annoying with flies needs to declare allergy restrictions
the ambience was great best pizza in the town i would visit place from time to time
best cafe
gostamos bastante desse restaurante tanto que viemos duas vezes comemos o frango grelhado com pure de batatas e legumes a massa da casa que e bem azeitada feita com cogumelos legumes azeitonas pretas ambos os pratos foram muito bem preparados da outra vez optamos pela pizza que estava muito gostosa ale disso tem uma boa carta de vinhos e cervejas foi uma otima opcao para variar um pouco da culinaria local recomendo
good pizza service a bit slow
great spot if you are looking for a more american style breakfast while in kathmandu the omelette had green chili peppers giving it a delicious kick
we enjoyed the mexicana pizza and it was truly one of the best pizzas weve experienced in kathmandu the thin crust juicy toppings and rich flavor made it delightful however we felt the service could have been a bit more attentive the nighttime atmosphere was warm and inviting
roadhouse never disappoints
italy quality pizza absolutely delicious the staff was nice but could pay a bit more attention to the needs of their clients then this place would get a in every aspect
good ambience
hello hello
great ambiance great good
great ambiance with great service
amazing food and great service very welcoming staff and the pizza is amazing we had the farmhouse pizza id highly recommend
had a lovely evening great ambiance brilliant food and friendly service prices were really good for the very high quality food i got the farmhouse pizza which was fresh vegetables on puffed dough
great wines had gnocchi with prawns and were drowned in pesto why oh why i was looking forward to the prawn buttery juices to flavor real potato gnocchi but this was a mess they always over complicate things
best and ranked on top inside kathmandu valleyit is very famous for fire pizza
the food was delicious and the service very friendly we come back next year
decoracao excelente a simpatia dos funcionarios e a comida excelente
the place is usually packed we tore through the pork chop it was really good but the smashed potatoes werent great the chunky bits kinda ruined it the fruity fresca drink was good
lovely place with lovely pizza
really good food thanks for all staff
blagodaryu vkusno priyatnaya atmosfera i obsluzhivanie rekomenduyu
nice ambience
pizza grilled chicken and brownie excelent we were served a new drink after the first one didnt match our taste excelent service great place to eat
ambience was good coffee was amazing and mrrohans service was great
this is the place for an amazing thin crust pizza situated right in the middle of my favorite part of kathmandu away from the diesel smoke pollution of the main roads this place has everything going for it the atmosphere is second to none and its amplified as soon as the sun sets in the western sky you wont find the locals here but youll spot people from round the globe conversing about their hiking tales front sided or post many delicious meals are available all within a travelers budget sample the local premium nepali beer gorkha if a portuguese man mated with a lady from nepal youd have the manchild pictured on the label with the tagline dedicated to the brave he looks as if he could be the cocky grandson of the sandeman port dude minus the famous cape enjoy
everything is excellent the food the service all incredible fav place in katmandu we ordered the diavolo pizza and lasagna all wood cooked incredible place
